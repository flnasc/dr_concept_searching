   Description: This is the first step in our preprocessing pipeline. This role of this program is to segment the text.

            Query: If the concept-word exsists in the top 4 words of a topic, all the paragraphs associated with that topic and have
            the concept word are returned

            After each successful query, the results are formated into an excel file and written to the results folder.

   Status: Finished
   NOTES: Concept path and results path are hard-coded
