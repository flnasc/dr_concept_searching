Seg: It seems tempting, at first, to begin with the most elaborate, the most rationalized expressions of that confession, in the hope that those expressions will be closest to the language of philosophy in virtue of their “explanatory” character. Thus, one will be inclined to think that it is against the late constructions of the Augustinian epoch concerning original sin that philosophy is challenged to measure itself. Many philosophies, classical and modem, take this supposed concept as a religious and theological datum and reduce the philosophical problem of fault to a critique of the idea of original sin.

Seg: , This language of confession is the counterpart of the triple character of the experience it brings to light: blindness, equivocalness, scandalousness. AssociationValue: 0.8874825307414942


Seg: Moreover, the merely semantic understanding that we can acquire from the vocabulary of fault is an exercise preparatory to the hermeneutics of myths. Indeed, it is itself already a hermeneutics, for the most primitive and least mythical language is already ' a symbolic language: defilement is spoken of under the symbol of a stain or blemish, sin under the symbol of missing the mark, of a tortuous road, of trespass, etc. In short, the preferred language of fault appears to be indirect and based on imagery. There is something quite astonishing in this: the consciousness of self seems to constitute itself at its lowest level by means of symbolism and to work out an abstract language only subsequently, by means of a spontaneous hermeneutics of its primary symbols. We shall see later the extensive implications of this assertion. For the moment it is enough to have established that the “re-enactment” in sympathetic imagination always moves in the element of language as reflection reverts from gnosis to myth and from myth to the primaiy symbolic expressions brought into play in the confession of fault. This rever-. sion to the primary symbols permits us henceforth to consider myths and gnosis as secondary and tertiary symbols, the interpretation of which rests on the interpretation of the primary symbols.

Seg: Confession, we have said, always manifests itself in the element of language. Now, that language is essentially symbolic. Hence a philosophy that is concerned to integrate confession with the consciousness of self cannot escape the task of elaborating, at least in outline, a criteriology of symbols.

Seg: in a fragment of the cosmos, which, in return, loses its concrete limits, gets charged with innumerable meanings, integrates and unifies the greatest possible number of the sectors of anthropocos-mic experience. First of all, then, it is the sun, the moon, the waters—that is to say, cosmic realities—that are symbols. Shall we say, therefore, that symbols, in their cosmic aspect, are anterior to language, or even foreign to it? Not at all. For these realities to be a symbol is to gather together at one point a mass of significations which, before giving rise to thought, give rise to speech. The symbolic manifestation as a thing is a matrix of symbolic meanings as words. We have never ceased to find meanings in the sky (to take the first example on which Eliade practices his comparative phenomenology). It is the same thing to say that the sky manifests the sacred and to say that it signifies the most high, the elevated and the immense, the powerful and the orderly, the clairvoyant and the wise, the sovereign, the immutable. The manifestation through the thing is like the condensation of an infinite discourse; manifestation and meaning are strictly contemporaneous and reciprocal; the concretion in the thing is the counterpart of the surcharge of inexhaustible meaning which has ramifications in the cosmic, in the ethical, and in the political. Thus, the symbol-thing is the potentiality of innumerable spoken symbols which, on the other hand, are knotted together in a single cosmic manifestation. AssociationValue: 0.49785044632700276


Seg: Now, this double “expressivity”—cosmic and psychic—has its complement in a third modality' of symbols: poetic imagination. But, to understand it properly, it is necessary firmly to distinguish imagination from image, if by image is understood a function of absence, the annulment of the real in an imaginary unreal. This image-representation, conceived on the model of a portrait of the absent, is still too dependent on the thing that it makes unreal; it remains a process for making present to oneself the things of the world. A poetic image is much closer to a word than to a portrait. As M. Bachelard excellently says, it “puts us at the origin of the speaking being”; “it becomes a new being of our language, it expresses us in making us that which it expresses.” Unlike the two other modalities of symbols, hierophanic and oneiric, the poetic AssociationValue: 0.35341909215037637


Seg: symbol shows us expressivity in its nascent state. In poetry the symbol is caught at the moment when it is a welling up of language, “when it puts language in a state of emergence,” instead of being regarded in its hieratic stability under the protection of rites and myths, as in the history of religions, or instead of being deciphered through the resurgences of a suppressed infancy.

Seg: Taken in its origin—that is to say, in its matrix of terror—this initial intuition is the intuition of primordial fatality. The invincible bond between Vengeance and defilement is anterior to any institution, any intention, any decree; it is so primitive that it is anterior even to the representation of an avenging god. The automatism in the sanction that the primitive consciousness dreads and adores expresses this a priori synthesis of avenging wrath, as if the fault wounded the potency of the interdict and as if that injury ineluctably triggered the response. Man confessed this ineluctability long before he recognized the regularity of the natural order. When he first wished to express the order in the world, he began by expressing it in the language of retribution. The famous fragment of AssociationValue: 0.4560775962245875


Seg: The Hebrew example is still more striking. <4><5> Indeed, it might be alleged that the Greeks never attained the feeling of sin in its peculiar quality and with the intensity of which only the people of Israel supply an example, and that that is why the Greeks had no other recourse than to “transpose philosophically” the schema of defilement. It must still be shown just why the theme of the pure and the impure could lend itself to such a transposition. The Hebrew experience makes the question even more urgent. It is not only ritual legislation that preserves the belief in defilement in Israel; even the experience of sin itself, the profound originality of which in comparison with the experience of defilement we shall show further on, is expressed in the old language of defilement. Thus, the prophet Isaiah, at the time of his vision in the Temple, cries: “Woe is me! I am undone. For I am a man of unclean lips . . . and mine eyes have seen the King, Yahweh Sabaoth.” And after the seraph had touched his lips with the live coal from the altar: “Behold, this hath touched thy lips,—thy sin is taken away, —thine iniquity is expiated” (Is, 6:5, 7). Later, in the confession which is attributed after the event to David and which we shall cite further on in the framework not only of the consciousness of sin but of the feeling of guilt, the psalmist entreats: “Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness; according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my sin. Wash me from all iniquity; cleanse me from my fault, . . . O God, create in me a pure heart” (Ps. 51). The theme of defilement must be very strong and very, rich to have thus survived the magical and ritual conception that was its first vehicle. AssociationValue: 0.3029077750620116


Seg: The case of the murderer is striking in this respect. We have said above what basis shed blood provides for a literal interpretation of defilement. Nowhere else, unless in sexuality, does it appear more difficult to distinguish defilement from stain. Here, it seems, we have the model and, as it were, the limiting case of all impure contacts. Nevertheless, the defilement that comes from spilt blood is not something that can be removed by washing. Moreover, the maleficent power of which the murderer is the bearer is not a taint that exists absolutely without reference to a field of human presence, to 'words that express the defilement. A man is defiled in the sight of certain men, in the language of certain men. Only he is defiled who is regarded as defiled; a law is required to say it; the interdict is itself a defining utterance. It is necessary also to say what must be done in order that the impure may become pure; there is no rite without words that confer a meaning upon the action and consecrate its efficacy; the rite is never mute; and if no words accompany it, something said earlier provides the foundation for it. AssociationValue: 0.4753405437892285


Seg: This “education” of the feeling of impurity by the language which defines and legislates is of capital importance. Because of it, it is no longer only the action, the gesture, the rite which is symbolic; the pure and the impure themselves, as representations, create for themselves a symbolic language capable of transmitting AssociationValue: 0.939987631386886


Seg: As for us, men of the West, it is to classical Greece that we owe our vocabulary of the pure and the impure. Now, it is remarkable that the formation of this language of defilement is in large part dependent on an imaginary experience connected with imaginary examples. It is a veritable cultural creation, relatively late, designed to reinterpret a fabled past and to give the Greek an ethical memory.	. AssociationValue: 0.8939261846713333


Seg: It is also the drama which, from the simply semantic point of view, plays the most important role in this formation of a symbolic language. It has been remarked that the words fitaa-fia, ny\U, /41W, and pioivav are very rare in .prose when murder is spoken of; they are employed only to expound a doctrine or to relate a legend. It was in imagining monstrous defilements in legendary criminals that the poets opened the way to a symbolics of impurity. AssociationValue: 0.7653172866015231


Seg: This relation to defining language and a human environment, which the Greek writings clearly show, can be discovered even in the most primitive forms of the prohibition of defilement studied by Frazer and Pettazzoni. The involuntary or unconscious actions, the material events, the accidents which provoke the emotion of impurity and require a process of purification, are not just any happenings; they always qualify a human environment. The fire into which the frog has jumped, the tent near which the hyena has left his excrements, belong to a space haunted by man, qualified by his presence and his acts.

Seg: element in relation to the verbal ejection and expulsion of evil which is confession in the strict sense. It is a beginning of appropriation and, at the same time, of elucidation of dread in the element of language. Dread expressed in words is no longer simply a cry, but an avowal. In short, it is by being refracted in words that dread reveals an ethical rather than a physical aim. AssociationValue: 0.7483480503649429


Seg: This initial situation, this disconcerting initiative that calls and elects, appears suddenly and becomes silent, is no less foreign to philosophical discourse—at least discourse instituted by a reason defined by universality and non-temporality—than defilement, interdict, and vengeance. But, just as defilement was related to philosophical meditation insofar as it had the character of language, or the word (parole)—the word of prohibition and rite, the word of confession,—so the Covenant as word penetrates into the same space of reflection. The ruah of Yahweh in the Old Testament, which we translate by Spirit for lack of a better term, designates the irrational aspect of the Covenant; but this ruah is also davar, word (parole) , It is no accident that the only suitable equivalent of the Hebrew davar was the Greek logos. This translation, even though only approximate and inexact, was itself an important cultural event. It expresses the conviction, first, that all languages are translatable into one another, and that all cultures belong to a single humanity; and then that we must seek the least bad equivalent for the calling of man by God in the logos, in which the Greeks recognized the unity of ratio and oratio. The projection of the Hebrew davar upon the Greek logos, a projection pregnant with equivocations in one sense, marked first of all the recognition of this fact: the initial situation of man as God’s prey can enter into the universe of discourse because it is itself analyzable into an utterance of God and an utterance of man, into the reciprocity of 8 A N6her, VEssence du prophUtsme (Paris, 1955), pp. 85-116.

Seg: It is remarkable that the Hebrew Bible does not have any abstract word to express sin, but a bundle of concrete expressions, each of which, in its own way, is the beginning in a figurative manner of a possible line of interpretation and announces what might be called a “theologoumenon.” <19> Moreover, it will not be without interest, as we enumerate the Hebraic images and roots, to note the corresponding images and roots of the Greek language which, in their turn, were able to furnish equivalents to the Hebraic schemata when the Bible was translated into Greek. Furthermore, this translation is an important cultural event; it united the destinies of the two languages and gave rise to a Helleno-Hebraic AssociationValue: 0.7793576469279226


Seg: Finally, the Greek example is especially fitted to persuade us that the tragic vision of the world is tied to a spectacle and not to a speculation. This third trait is not without relation to the preceding one; for, if the secret of tragic anthropology is theological, that theology of making blind is perhaps unavowable, unacceptable for thought. The plastic and dramatic expression of the tragic would not, then, be a reclothing, much less an incidental disguise, of a conception of man that could have been expressed otherwise in plain language.

Seg: Besides, it is possible that those to whom we owe the institution of initiations were not without merit, but that it is really the truth which has lain hidden from olden times under their enigmatic language: whoever arrives in Hades profane and uninitiated lies in the mud, while he who has been purified and initiated will dwell with the gods when he arrives there. For, as those who concern themselves with initiations say, the thyrsus-bearers are many, the bacchantes are few. Now the latter, in my opinion, are those whose occupation has been philosophy in the strict sense of the term. AssociationValue: 0.8168304600577676


Seg: This text is of great importance if one considers that Platonism is throughout a justification of language, laying the foundations of language first in the reality of meaning, then in the dialectical structure of meaning. If, then, man is essentially speech, the “passions” of speech are cardinal passions. Parmenides had already noted the bond connecting opinion, error, and confusion in naming, Now the “passions” of speech are not passive passions, so to speak. As political life shows, falsifications of language are active counterfeitings of true speech; they constitute a world of para—a paralogy—a world centered on the category of the Pseudo; they are “imitations” of discussion, of the restraint imposed by truth, and of the agreement of interlocutors in the same logos. We see how this theme of “falsehood” reacts on the theme of “desire,” which seemed to throw the blame for evil on the body. Desire is evil only because it is no longer strictly corporeal; it must be seized by a frenzy of immoderation; and immoderation comes to desire only through “falsehood.” The tyrant is the living proof of the madness that takes possession of desire. The tyrant, indeed, is for philosophy a magnitude that is more than political and is, properly speaking, metaphysical, because he is the symbol of the man who has the power to satisfy all his desires; he is the myth of unlimited desire—unlimited because it is ministered to by a power that is itself not limited by law. Now the tyrant gives evidence that this body of desire undergoes a sort of mutation from the fact of the unjust soul which inhabits it, that desire is a creation of injustice and not vice versa.

Seg: The hiatus between pure reflection on “fallibility” and the confession of “sins” is patent. Pure reflection makes no appeal to any myth or symbol; in this sense it is a direct exercise of rationality. But comprehension of evil is a sealed book for it; the reflection is pure, but it leaves everyday reality outside, insofar as man’s everyday reality is “enslavement to the passions.” On the other hand, the enigma of servile freedom is avowed by the religious consciousness, but at the price of a methodological rupture in the continuity of reflection. Not only does the confession of sins appeal to a differ-  ent quality of experience, but it has recourse to a different language, which we have shown to be symbolic through and through. Is it possible, after this rupture, to come back to pure reflection and to enrich it with all that we have gained from the symbolic knowledge of evil? AssociationValue: 0.5825990531497687


Seg: Recourse to the archaic, the nocturnal, the oneiric, which is also, as Bachelard says in his Poetique de VEspace, a way of approaching the birthplace of language, represents an attempt to escape the difficulties of a radical beginning in philosophy. The beginning is not what one finds first; the point of departure must be reached, it must be won. Understanding of symbols can play a part in the movement towards the point of departure; for, if the beginning is to be reached, it is first necessary for thought to inhabit the fullness of language. We know the harassing backward flight of thought in search of the first truth and, more radically still, in search of a point of departure that might well not be a first truth. The illusion is not in looking for a point of departure, but in looking for it without presuppositions. There is no philosophy without presuppositions. A meditation on symbols starts from speech that has already taken place, and in which everything has already been said in some fashion; it wishes to be thought with its presuppositions.

Seg: Moreover, this task has a precise meaning now> at a certain stage in philosophical discussion, and, more broadly, in connection with certain traits of our “modernity.” The historical moment of the philosophy of symbols is that, of forgetfulness and restoration. Forgetfulness of hierophanies, forgetfulness of the signs of the sacred, loss of man himself insofar as he belongs to the sacred. The forgetfulness, we know, is the counterpart of the great task of nourishing men, of satisfying their needs by mastering nature through a planetary technique. It is in the age when our language has become more precise, more univocal, more technical in a word, more suited to those integral formalizations which are called precisely symbolic logic, it is in this very age of discourse that we want to recharge our language, that we want to start again from the fullness of language.

Seg: The enterprise would be a hopeless one if symbols were radically alien to philosophical discourse. But symbols are already in the element of speech. We have said sufficiently that they rescue feeling and even fear from silence and confusion; they provide a language for avowal, for confession; in virtue of them, man remains language through and through. That is not the most important thing: there exists nowhere a symbolic language without hermeneutics; wherever a man dreams or raves, another man arises to give an interpretation; what was already discourse, even if incoherent, is brought into coherent discourse by hermeneutics. In this respect, the hermeneutics of modem men is continuous with the spontaneous interpretations that have never been lacking to symbols. On the other hand, what is peculiar to the modern hermeneutics is that it remains in the line of critical thought. But its critical function does not turn it away from its appropriative function; I should say, rather, that it makes it more authentic and more perfect. The dissolution of the myth as explanation is the necessary way to the restoration of the myth as symbol. Thus, the time of restoration is not a different time from that of criticism; we are in every way children of criticism, and we seek to go beyond criticism by means of criticism, by a criticism that is no longer reductive but restorative. That is the purpose which animated Schelling, Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and today, in various ways, Leenhardt, van der Leeuw, Bliade, Jung, Bultmann. Today we have a more acute awareness of the immensity of the wager of this hermeneutics. On the one hand, it represents the advanced point of criticism, as an awareness of the myth as myth. By that awareness it hastens the movement of demythologization, which is only the counterpart of an ever more rigorous decision about what is history according to the historical method; demythologization is the irreversible gain of truthfulness, intellectual honesty, objectivity.

Seg: Such is the wager. Only he can object to this mode of thought who thinks that philosophy, to begin from itself, must be a philosophy without presuppositions, A philosohy that starts from the fullness of language is a philosophy with presuppositions. To be honest, it must make its presuppositions explicit, state them as beliefs, wager on the beliefs, and try to make the wager pay off in understanding. AssociationValue: 0.5321316970329358
