Topic: 6
Seg: Now, the Hebraic and Hellenic literatures give evidence of a linguistic inventiveness that marks the existential eruptions of this consciousness of fault. It is by discovering the motivations of those linguistic inventions that we re-enact the passage from defilement to sin and guilt. Thus, the Hebrew and Greek words that express the consciousness of fault have a sort of wisdom of their own which we must make explicit and take as our guide in the labyrinth of living experience. We are not, therefore, reduced to the ineffable when we try to dig beneath the myths of evil, we still come up with a language. 0.6964910339671754
Seg: We have tried to view the new experience of fault in as close proximity as possible to the drama of the Covenant in which it gets meaning. But this experience is not mute; the summons of the prophet, the confession of the sinner issue forth in the element of language. Moreover, we could not omit this impact of the experience of sin on discourse when we examined the diverse modalities of prophetic accusation: injustice according to Amos, adultery according to Hosea, arrogance according to Isaiah, lack of faith according to Jeremiah, etc. 0.34925203334368293
Seg: There is no question of denying that the personal imputation of fault marks an advance over the scandalous collective responsibility that permits someone other than the guilty person to be punished. But it must be understood that the price of this advance is the loss of the unity of the human species, gathered together “before God” by the more than biological and more than liistorical bond of fault. The pseudo-concept of original sin is only the rationalization at the third degree, through the Adamic myth, of that enigmatic bond which is acknowledged rather than understood in the “we” of the confession of sins. 0.5565520737719636
Seg: guilt is not synonymous with fault. All our reflections protest against this identification, which destroys the tensions essential to the consciousness of fault. 0.6948716244739667
Seg: Two reasons determine our resistance to this reduction of fault to guilt. In the first place, guilt, considered by itself, leads in several directions: in the direction of an ethico-juridical reflection on the relation of penalty to responsibility; in the direction of an ethico-religious reflection on a delicate and scrupulous conscience; and finally, in the direction of a psycho-theological reflection on the hell of an accused and condemned conscience. Penal rationalization in the Greek manner, internalization and refinement of ethical awareness in the Judaic manner, consciousness of the wretchedness of man under the regime of the Law and of the works of the Law in the Paulinian manner—these are three divergent possibilities which the notion of guilt carries. Now, it is not possible to understand directly the intimate connection among these three aspects of guilt, which are in constant opposition,.two by two: the rationality of the Greek against the religiosity of the Jew and the Christian; the internality of “piety” against the externality of the city or of salvation by grace; Paulinian antilegalism against the law of the tribunal and against Mosaic law. All the rest of this chapter will be entirely devoted to this splintering of the idea of guilt. But to be able to perceive this internal dialectic of guilt, one must set it in a vaster dialectic, that of the three moments of fault: defilement, sin, guilt. 0.5276480615052929
Seg: Let the “I” be emphasized more than the “before thee,” let the “before thee” be even forgotten, and the consciousness of fault becomes guilt and no longer sin at all; it is “conscience” that now becomes the measure of evil in a completely solitary experience. It is not by accident that in many languages the same word designates moral consciousness (conscience morale), and psychological and reflective consciousness; guilt expresses above all the promotion of “conscience” as supreme. 0.5602247220233486
Seg: The birth of a new “measure” of fault is a decisive event in the history of the notion of fault; and this event represents a double advance, from which it is not possible to turn back. 0.4169727312761987
Seg: Thus the tension between the “realism” of sin and the “phenomenalism” of guilt has as its first corollai’y the individualization of imputation. A new opposition arises in the consciousness of fault: according to the schema of sin, evil is a situation “in which” mankind' is caught as a single collective; according to the schema 0.5851342591984643
Seg: of guilt, evil is an act that each individual “begins.” This pulverization of fault into a multiplicity of subjective guilts puts in question the “we” of the confession of sins and makes evident the loneliness of the guilty conscience. 0.9399869980712336
Seg: The significance of guilt, then, is the possibility of the primacy of “man the measure” over the “sight of God”; the division between individual fault and the sin of the people, the opposition between a graduated imputation and an all-inclusive accusation anticipate this reversal. By all these traits reflection has led us to the crossing of the three roads along which this new experience proceeds.  <34> 0.5676006421519676
Seg: The contribution of the Greeks to this third stage in the consciousness of fault differs profoundly from the contribution of the Jews in virtue of the role played in it by the direct application of reflection to the city, to its legislation, and to the organization of penal law. Here it is not a Covenant, ethical monotheism, a per- 0.3443755231475821
Seg: fore this reforming work of reflection, the distinction, purely penal, between the voluntary and the involuntary, remained imprecise; thus, the ‘Voluntary” sometimes involved premeditation, sometimes simple volition, while the “involuntary” embraced absence of fault, negligence, imprudence, sometimes cases of being carried away, or simple accidents, 0.7184227743542259
Seg: discussion, wounds inflicted in a state of intoxication, revenge for an outrage in the case of a flagrant act of adultery—all such acts a man repents when he returns to reason, as Lysias remarks (Moulinier, 190); so there is some fault and yet no irpovola, and even a certain conformity to the laws, It was more precisely accidents in games and mistakes in war that provoked the most rigorous reflection; and one can see why. In these two situations the social bond that underlies the holding of games and the conduct of war is a civic bond, which extends beyond and_ engulfs the two family groups of the plaintiff and the defendant set at variance by the murder. In such a case society becomes aware of its sympathy and indulgence for the murderer; in its turn this sympathy, which itself extends beyond and engulfs the anger of a wronged family, invents a juridical expression for itself by creating a suitable penal category. 0.4647780351708551
Seg: 6 Moulinier also calls attention to the idea of &pdprr}pa: “It seems theological involuntariness, so to speak, to psychological involuntariness is most remarkable; for the apapria that was the result of being blinded by the gods was imprinted, as if passively, upon the heart: “If anyone here has other prayers for the state,” cries the leader of the chorus in Agamemnon, “let him reap the fruit of the crime of his heart” (ffrptv&v... dpaprlav; Ag.} 502). “Errors of my foolish wisdom” (tw <f>pzv6)i> $vtr<f>pdva>v d/xa/mj/xara), replies Creon to the chorus, which has just contrasted the misfortune that comes from another (aWorpiav drrfv) to one’s own fault (auros dpapTW; Antigone, 1259-61).. The history of the word reveals that it subsequently denoted the intentional moment in injustice, and then, within the “voluntary,” that degree which Aristotle placed between an injustice that is clearly voluntary and an accident that is clearly involuntary, as in the Rhetoric, I, 12-13: “apapTrjpaTa are faults committed after forethought, but without malice; while dSiKrjpara imply both forethought and malice, and arvxnpara imply neither” (Moulinier, 188). 0.6209388871286515
Seg: This evolution of dpapria in the direction of excusable fault did not prevent a development in a contrary direction, equally 0.5266211231966673
Seg: inherent in the initial indignation aroused by crime. In the Antigone of Sophocles we came upon the contrast between the “misfortune that comes from another” (aWorptav artjv) and “one’s own fault” (auros agapTm’, 1260).  AgAprngaf then, could just as well lead to the notion of moral fault, in contrast to faults punished by the tribunals. The agaprijga of the Greek Bible, which denotes the ethico-religious dimension of fault, is an extension of this meaning. It is fundamentally the same meaning that was adumbrated in the Antigone of Sophocles. 0.35046238357790443
Seg: This surcharge of meaning in agapryga is found also in arv^ga, which marks the limit of extenuation. We referred above to Aristotle’s effort to arrange “injustice,” “excusable. fault,” and “accident” in order. But it must not be forgotten that rvyr}, before being the limit of penal non-responsibility, and hence the inverse of the guilt of voluntary and premeditated crime, was the heir of goipa in the tragic view it is not the opposite of crime, but crime itself as allotted destiny. There is misfortune (£vg<f>opa), luck in the form of bad luck, in the greatest crimes. In Demosthenes one sees eidled murderers, guilty of premeditated crimes, called aryxowres (Mou-Hnier, 189). Thus the same words betray the crossing of several conceptual “series”—the series of “defilement” and the series of “injustice,” the series of “misfortune” and the series of the “voluntary.” 0.7376905633805864
Seg: Ritualization, sedimentation;, separation of the scrupulous conscience—these traits do not make the scrupulous man a monster: the limitations of scrupulousness are the counterpart of its depth. Scrupulousness is the advanced point of the experience of fault, the recapitulation, in the subtle and delicate conscience, of defilement, sin, and guilt; but it is at this advance-post that the whole of that experience is on the point of capsizing. 0.3802598837485473
Seg: The "curse of the law” reveals the meaning of the whole prior development of the consciousness of fault. To understand this point, let us go back not only to the Pharisees, but to the core of the notion of guilt. Guilt, we have said, is the completed internalization of sin, With guilt, "conscience” is bom; a responsible agent appears, to face the prophetic call and its demand for holiness. But with the factor of "conscience” man the measure likewise comes into being; the realism of sin, measured by the eye of God, is absorbed into the phenomenalism of the guilty conscience, which is the measure' of itself. If this analysis is brought to the light of the Pauline experience of justification by the works of the law, it appears that the promotion of guilt—with its acute sense of individual responsibility, its taste for degrees and nuances in imputation, its moral tact—is at the same time the advent of self-righteousness and the curse attached thereto. Simultaneously, the experience of scrupulousness itself undergoes a radical re-interpretation: that in it which had not been felt as fault, becomes fault; the attempt to reduce sin by observance becomes sin. That is the real meaning of the curse of the law. 0.5504018128342907
Seg: AT THE END of our double approach—through the abstract description of fallibility and through the “re-enactment” of the religious consciousness of fault—the question arises: How shall we continue? 0.4936614080957989
