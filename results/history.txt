Seg: These cosmic resonances, reaching even into reflective consciousness, are less surprising if the second dimension of symbolism is taken into consideration—the oneiric dimension. It is in dreams that one can catch sight of the most fundamental and stable symbolisms of humanity passing from the “cosmic” function to the “psychic” function. We should not be able to comprehend how symbols can signify the bond between the being of man and total being if we opposed to one another the hierophanies described by the phenomenology of religion and the dream productions described by Freudian and Jungian psychoanalysis (at least those which, by Freud’s own admission, go beyond the projections of individual history and plunge beneath the private archeology of a subject into the common representations of a culture, or into the folklore of humanity as a whole). To manifest the “sacred” on the “cosmos” and to manifest it in the “psyche” are the same thing. AssociationValue: 0.41148558998439977


Seg: 1.	That symbols are signs is certain: they are expressions that communicate a meaning) this meaning is declared in an intention of signifying which has speech as its vehicle. Even when the symbols are elements of the universe (sky, water, moon) or things (tree, stone set up), it is still in the universe of discourse that these realities take on a symbolic dimension (words of consecration or invocation, mythical utterances). As Dumezil very well says: “It is under the sign of logos and not under that of mana that research [in the history of religions] takes its stand today.” AssociationValue: 0.5159580774309415


Seg: This reflection at first went astray and came up against an impasse: the belief that all suffering is the actual realization of this retribution. Thus the demand for a just punishment found itself confused with the explanation of actual suffering. But this “etiological” usage of the demand for a just punishment was so far from exhausting the law of retribution that the latter survived the crisis of the religious consciousness that shook and ruined the explanation of suffering by sin. Not only did it survive, but, thanks to that crisis, it revealed itself as a demand, beyond any explanation. And conscience, not finding the manifestation of the law of retribution any longer in real suffering, looked for its satisfaction in other directions, whether at the end of history, in a Last Judgment, or in some exceptional event, such as the sacrifice of a victim offered for the sins of the world, or by means of penal laws elaborated by society with the intention of making the penalty proportionate to the crime, or by means of a wholly internal penalty, accepted as penance. We are not concerned here with the legitimacy and the compatibility of these multiple expressions of the law of retribution: Last Judgment, expiatory sacrifice, juridical penalty, internal penance. Their mere enumeration sufficiently attests that the demand implicit in the law of retribution is not exhausted in the archaic explanation of all human ills by the evil of fault.

Seg: advance from discovering God as wrath to encountering him as mercy. To become oneself the tribunal of oneself is to be alienated. We shall have to say later how this alienation, upon which we have been attempting to throw light through the notion of justification by works, can also be understood after the fashion of Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Sartre; but the Pauline stratum underlies all these stratifications of our ethical history. It may be that the introduction of all these other interpretations of ethical alienation is itself the counterpart of forgetting its most radical meaning, just as guilt, with its rational indictment, is at once an advance and a forgetting in relation to sin understood as a crisis in the Covenant.

Seg: This new level of expression embarrasses the modern man. In one sense, he alone can recognize the myth as myth, because he alone has reached the point where history and myth become separate. This “crisis,” this decision, after which myth and history are dissociated, may signify the loss of the mythical dimension: AssociationValue: 0.377868454498968


Seg: going forth to the encounter with the hostile forces; the banquet of the gods celebrates the victory over chaos; and, finally, the sacred marriage revives all the life-giving forces m nature and man. By this fusion with the vegetation liturgy the epic myth becomes charged with all the symbolism suggested to man by the periodic decay and renewal of natural life, while the agrarian rite is inserted into a cosmic epic that can be extended not only in the direction of nature, but in the direction of the history and political destiny of mankind.

Seg: But it is especially by the role of the king in the festival that the transition from cosmic drama to history is effected. The king is both the grand penitent, in whom the service of the gods is epitomized, and the personification of the bound and delivered god. On the fifth day of the festival, the king is stripped of his emblems and struck by the priest; he makes a declaration of innocence; the priest speaks words of appeasement to him, reclothes him in his insignia, strikes him again to draw from him tears that probably signify the good will of the god; the king, thus reinstalled, can play the role of officiant in the great ceremony of renewal. This scene of humiliation is a kind of deposition which associates the precariousness of his kingship with the captivity of the dying god and bases the renewal of his sovereignty on the victory of the delivered god, AssociationValue: 0.9857125949876451


Seg: This participation of the king in the festival is the epitome of all the ties that bind the human to the divine, the political to the cosmic, history to the cult. We can truly say that the king is Man. An Assyrian proverb says: “Man is the shadow of the god and [other] men are the shadow of Man; Man is the king, who is like the mirror of the god.” AssociationValue: 0.9608648167836096


Seg: pated from his body by confession and various rites of elimination ; <69> that is "why the royal priest, the royal worshiper, becomes the royal penitent, <70> Thus placed in the perspective of the creation-myth, against the background of the pain of being, the kingship, in which the humanity of man is epitomized, appears as wretched as it is great—dominated, finally, by the anguish arising from the instability of order. The revocable investiture of the king introduces a factor of unforeseeability into history; the gods have changed and can change their earthly servant. They have only to transfer the kingship to another city or another state, to raise up the scourge of a tyrant or a foreign avenger, just as among themselves they grant supremacy now to one, now to another. AssociationValue: 0.7309032620563979


Seg: In the second place, the paradigm of the King can be “histori-cized”—and, in the same measure, “demythologized”—in virtue of the same combats that put to the test his kingship, established from the beginning. We have seen above that the King does not only “re-enact” the drama of creation, he evolves a genuine “history”; from the ritual combat one passes insensibly to the historical combat. Royal laments—for example. Psalm 89:39-52, which celebrates in the minor mode the sufferings of the king—favored this historicization more than anything else, while the hymn of enthronement leads more naturally to the primordial establishment of the kingship. While it revives the primordial anguish of the time when chaos had not yet been overcome, the royal lament plunges into the thick of genuine historical perils. It is David, fleeing before his son Absalom, who cries: “Yahweh, how are they increased that trouble me l Many are they that rise up against me. Many there be which say of my soul, There is no salvation for him in his God” (Ps. 3:1-2). “How long, Yahweh, wilt thou forget me? Unto the end?” (Ps. 13:1). At the limit, the theme may be “de-mythologized” and “moralized” to such a degree that it loses all connection with any precise history; the faithful of Judaism and Christianity could legitimately interpret “the adversary,” “the oppressor,” in the sense of adversity—that is to say, misfortune—or of diabolical temptation—that is to say, temptation by the Evil One. But the "demythologization” of the Enemy and his “historicization” in the guise of Egypt, or the Philistines, or the Assyrians, were a necessary stage on the road to this “moral” and once again “mythical” transposition of the Adversary. Moreover, the Christians gave a “Christological” interpretation to the lament of the innocent one persecuted, closer to the “suffering servant,” according to Second Isaiah, than to the king threatened by an historical enemy: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Ps. 22:1).

Seg: But the historical derivation of the themes can be followed in a thud diiection: that of the “eschatological” Kingdom. In the cultual schema salvation has been won, the King has conquered, creation has been completed; histoiy, with its perils, is not truly new; it re-enacts” the moment of tension of the cultual drama. Now let history become real, and the final victory is no longer an already attained moment of the drama, but a moment waited for at the end of time.” We see how the drama, in being demytholo-gized, becomes historicized, and, in becoming historicized, effects a sort of eschatological” carrying forward of its denouement. Thus the creation-drama was to break out nbt only in the direction of primordial Man or historical contingency, but in the direction of the much more recent figure of the "Son of Man,” whose coming fiom heaven is awaited by Daniel and Enoch; from the Messianic King within history to the transcendent, heavenly “Son of Man” the line of descent is continuous. Moreover, we can find an important stage in this “eschatological” transposition: the Child, the Prince of Peace, foretold by Isaiah (9:6), is already a figure of the End; he will restore the peace of Paradise; the wolf will dwell with the Iamb, the baby will play on the hole of the cobra. The Man of the end-time and primeval Man ultimately coincide; is this not because both are derived from the figure of the King, established from everlasting to everlasting?

Seg: the “adamig” myth is the anthropological myth par excellence; Adam means Man. But not every myth of “the primordial man” is an “Adamic” myth. Each of the other types of myth includes some reference to man: thus the figure of the King, in the theo-gonic myth, gives substance to a certain sort of history and to a . certain sort of political reality; but the origin of evil is not attributed to man in any peculiar sense in that myth. Likewise, the figure of the Titan, which fluctuates among the various types of myth, is very close to changing into the figure of the primordial man; but the Orphic “anthropogony,” which annexed the myth of the Titans to itself—at a late date, no doubt,—does not constitute an anthropogonic myth of evil: the being of man is itself the result of a drama anterior to man; the evil is that there are human beings; the genesis of evil coincides with anthropogony. Many other representations of the primordial man will be found at the gnostic level of speculation; but those speculations differ fundamentally from the Adamic theme because in them the genesis of the present condition of man is regularly considered as identical with the evil process displayed in the “eons” anterior to the present condition of man. AssociationValue: 0.3534725878293012


Seg: that preliminary myth the first sin appears as the loss of a prior mode of being, as the loss of innocence. The creation-story with which our story of the fall is integrated is not the admirable story with which our Bible opens, and which is articulated around the following verses: “God said, Let there be light: and there was light”j “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness”; “God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.” This story is the fruit of a long maturation. Yahweh had to become the master of universal history before he could be recognized as the master of the earth and the heavens without any risk of his being confounded with a natural force; but before he could be acclaimed as the master of histoiy, Jewish thought had to integrate the terrible ordeal of the national, destruction and exile, The older story that we read in the second chapter of Genesis antedates that catastrophe and the greater depth in religion that resulted from it; and so it is of a more rudimentary make (we need only compare the creative act of 2:7 with that of 1:26 ff.). AssociationValue: 0.9876687001401898


Seg: Let us go further: behind the projection of our lust, beyond the tradition of evil already there, there is perhaps an even more radical externality of evil, a cosmic structure of evil—not, doubtless, the lawfulness of the world as such, but its relation of indifference to the ethical demands of which man is both author and servant. From the spectacle of things, from the course of history, from the cruelty of nature and men, there comes a feeling of universal absurdity which invites man to doubt his destination; Gabriel Marcel speaks of the “invitation to betray” which seems inherent in the structure of our universe when we confront it with the fundamental intention of man’s being and with his desire for truth and happiness. There is thus a side of our world that confronts us as chaos and that is symbolized by the chthonic animal. For a human existent, this aspect of chaos is a structure of the universe; Aeschylus recognized it in the volcano Etna, in the thousand-headed Typhon, in the horror that adheres to gods and men, feeding the essential tragedy of the human condition. Prometheus and Oedipus on the one hand. Job on the other, recognized the cosmic dimensions of brute chaos. We shall return in the following chapter to this proximity of the theme of the serpent to tragedy. AssociationValue: 0.9899980325699743


Seg: Let us disregard for the moment the difficult question where and when this myth attained its final literary form. It has been said that the type which we are here setting forth was perfectly exemplified by archaic Orphism; there has even been an inclination to identify the myth of the exiled soul purely and simply with the Orphic myth. But, as we know, the problems raised by Orphism for the history of religions and the history of Greek thought are considerable, and we shall not attempt to conceal them. We know that all of Platonic and Neo-Platonic philosophy presupposes Orphism and draws nourishment from its substance, but we do not know exactly what sort of Orphism Plato was acquainted with and what the irakatbs Aoyo? of Orphism was like before the late revisions of the myth, That is why we must approach history armed with a theory of types such as we find in Max Weber’s Idealtypen, but prepared to correct the ideal outline of the "myth AssociationValue: 0.44800634124237526


Seg: To this major sign of the fateful character of freedom many others can be added. Who can realize himself without excluding not only possibilities but realities and existences, and, consequently, without destroying? Who can join the intensity of friendship and love to, the breadth of universal solidarity? It is a tragic aspect of existence that the history of self-awareness cannot begin with the sympathy of the Stoics, but must start with the struggle of master and slave, and that, once having consented to itself and to the universal, it fnust plunge anew into self-division.

Seg: The enterprise would be a hopeless one if symbols were radically alien to philosophical discourse. But symbols are already in the element of speech. We have said sufficiently that they rescue feeling and even fear from silence and confusion; they provide a language for avowal, for confession; in virtue of them, man remains language through and through. That is not the most important thing: there exists nowhere a symbolic language without hermeneutics; wherever a man dreams or raves, another man arises to give an interpretation; what was already discourse, even if incoherent, is brought into coherent discourse by hermeneutics. In this respect, the hermeneutics of modem men is continuous with the spontaneous interpretations that have never been lacking to symbols. On the other hand, what is peculiar to the modern hermeneutics is that it remains in the line of critical thought. But its critical function does not turn it away from its appropriative function; I should say, rather, that it makes it more authentic and more perfect. The dissolution of the myth as explanation is the necessary way to the restoration of the myth as symbol. Thus, the time of restoration is not a different time from that of criticism; we are in every way children of criticism, and we seek to go beyond criticism by means of criticism, by a criticism that is no longer reductive but restorative. That is the purpose which animated Schelling, Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and today, in various ways, Leenhardt, van der Leeuw, Bliade, Jung, Bultmann. Today we have a more acute awareness of the immensity of the wager of this hermeneutics. On the one hand, it represents the advanced point of criticism, as an awareness of the myth as myth. By that awareness it hastens the movement of demythologization, which is only the counterpart of an ever more rigorous decision about what is history according to the historical method; demythologization is the irreversible gain of truthfulness, intellectual honesty, objectivity.

Seg: Thus, speculation on original sin sends us back to the myth of the fall, and this, in its turn, sends us back to the confession of sins, The myth of the fall is so far from being the cornerstone of the Judeo-Christian conception of sin that the figure of Adam, placed by the myth at the origin of the history of human evil, remained a mute figure for practically all of the writers of the Old Testament, Abraham, the father of believers, the founder-ancestor of the elect people, and Noah, the father of post-diluvian humanity, produced more of an echo in the Biblical theology of history than the figure of Adam, which remained in a state of suspended animation, so to speak, until St. Paul revived it by making it parallel to the second Adam, Jesus Christ. At the same time, the “event” of the Christ transformed the fall of Adam retroactively into a similar “event”; the historicity of the second Adam, by reflection, conferred upon the first Adam a comparable historicity and an individuality cor-2 For the theory of myths, see the Introduction to Part II.

Seg: Not that any culture is excluded in principle; but in this area oriented by the originally Greek question, there are relations of “proximity” and “distance” that belong inescapably to the structure of our cultural memory, Hence the privilege of “proximity” of the Greek and Jewish cultures; these two cultures, which would contain nothing exceptional for an eye not situated anywhere in particular, constitute the first stratum of our philosophical memory. More precisely, the encounter of the Jewish source with the Greek origin is the fundamental intersection that founds our culture. The Jewish source is the first “other” of philosophy, its “nearest” other; the abstractly contingent fact of that encounter is the very fate of our occidental existence. Since our existence begins with it> this encounter has become necessary, in the sense that it is the presupposition of our undeniable reality. This is why the history of the consciousness of fault in Greece and in Israel will constantly be our central point of reference; it is our “nearest” origin, in this spiritual economy of distance.

Seg: brought all cultures together in a whole. In the meantime, neither the history of religions nor philosophy can be a concrete universal capable of embracing all human experience. On the one hand, the objectivity of science, without a point of view and without situation, does not equalize cultures except by neutralizing their value; it cannot think the positive reasons for their equal value. On the other hand, philosophy, as we have received it from the Greeks and perpetuated it in the West, will remain unequal to this concrete universal as long as no serious encounter and no mutual clarification have brought these civilizations into the field of our experience and at the same time removed its limitation. This encounter and this mutual clarification have not yet really taken place. They have taken place for some men and some groups and they have been the great concern of their lives; but they have remained episodic for our culture as a whole. This is why, up to the present, they have not had the significance of a foundation (as did the encounter of the Greek question with the Hebrew religion) and of a re-creation (as have the various renaissances and returns to sources in the bosom of Western culture). Their phenomenological character is precisely that they have remained episodic, and so the relation of our culture to the Far East remains a relation to something distant. No doubt we are drawing closer to the moment of a creative encounter and the reshaping of a memory based on the opposition of “near” and “far”; but we are not in a position to imagine what that will mean for the categories of our ontology and for our reading of the Pre-Socratics, Greek tragedy, and the Bible. But one thing is certain: we shall not enter into this great debate of each culture with all without our memory; the lessening of the distance between our civilization and those which today we still call “distant” will not suppress the structuration of our memory, but will complicate it. It will not cease to be true that we were born to philosophy by Greece and that as philosophers we have encountered the Jews before encountering the Hindus and the Chinese.

Seg: This subordination of the imperative to a word or utterance that includes it and confers upon it the dramatic accent of a summons, of an alliance, is reflected in the documents which the history of religions explores and which our phenomenology takes into account. The “codes” are not the only documents we have to be acquainted with, nor even the most important. The Jews, like the other Semitic peoples, elaborated ritual, penal, civil, and political codes to regulate conduct; but it is less in the letter of these codes than in their life and in the direction of their transformations that we must look for the Hebrew experience of sin. Now this life, this dynamism that produces the codes, is revealed in documents other than the codes—in “chronicles” that tell stories of sin and death, like the Chronicles of Saul and David; in the “hymns” in which distress, confession, and entreaty sing; in “oracles” in which the prophet accuses, warns, threatens; and finally in “sayings,” in which the imperative of the code, the lament of the psalm, the thunder of the oracle are reflected in wisdom. Such is the rich palette of the “knowledge” of sin; it is in proportion to the vast utterance in which the Covenant is proclaimed. AssociationValue: 0.39226085019197243


Seg: concerns the political fate of the community of Israel. This point is of capital importance and dominates to a great extent the distinction between sin and guilt that will be introduced later on. Guilt represents an internalization and a personalization of the consciousness of sin. This double operation will encounter the resistance of the historical and communal interpretation of sin which found in the theme of the Wrath of God and the Day of Yahweh its most powerful symbol. In fact, it is as a people that Israel feels itself threatened through the mouth of the prophet; it is by the roundabout way of a theology of history, of an oracle concerning the future of the community, that the people feels itself condemned. Historical failure is thus erected into a symbol of condemnation. AssociationValue: 0.3043709651881038

Seg: Is no longer the guarantor of the historical success of his people; the consciousness of sin, through the symbol of the Day of Yahweh and an inimical history, reveals its other pole: the Lord of History. This transcendence and this breadth are the correlatives of the ethical Holiness that is manifested in another way through the infinite demand. The threat places the Lord at a greater distance from history and shatters his historical complicity with the chosen people in the same way as the infinite demand introduced into the codes increases the ethical distance between God and man.

Seg: But if we put in question the “tradition of the Ancients” (Mark 7:1-13), which impresses its juridical style on all the relations of the human to the divine, how far back must we trace the origin of this aberration? Only to the oral tradition? But did not the written law issue from a like process? Is it not evident that very early in the history of Israel the Mosaic aspect of the dialogal situation was overvalued? The limitation of all scrupulous conscientiousness seems to me to be exemplified by what I should like to call the construction of a Mosaic fantasy: Moses is placed above all the Prophets; it is granted that he knew all the law for all times and for all men, and that the Prophets only repeated it; all the successive legislations—the Decalogue, Deuteronomy, Leviticus—are at. tributed to him; lastly, the oral law itself is absorbed into the Mosaic revelation. Thus all the modalities and all the stages of the religious experience are contracted into the figure of the legislator and into the single event of the giving of the Law. This absorption of all the outbursts of prophecy into the Mosaic figure seems to me to be the key to the formation of any scrupulous conscience; in every case you can find this movement of contraction of an actual tradition into something like an absolute “event,” by which this conscience was supposedly given to itself in the past; this gift of its ethos plays for it the role of a Torah, a divine instruction; the scrupulous conscience swears to be faithful, with understanding, zeal, humility, and joy, to this divine instruction in which, to its AssociationValue: 0.30404682616680734


Seg: Such, in brief, is the Pauline itinerary. With this experience we have arrived at the farthest limit of the whole cycle of guilt.

Seg: 1.	The first function of the myths of evil is to embrace mankind as a •whole in one ideal history. By means of a time that represents all times, “man” is manifested as a concrete universal; Adam signifies man. “In” Adam, says Saint Paul, we have all sinned.

Seg: 2.	The universality of man, manifested through the myths, gets its concrete character from the movement which is introduced into human experience by narration; in recounting the Beginning and the End of fault, the myth confers upon this experience an orientation, a character, a tension. Experience is no longer reduced to a present experience; this present was only an instantaneous cross-section in an evolution stretching from an origin to a fulfillment, from a “Genesis” to,an “Apocalypse.” Thanks to the myth, experience is traversed by the essential history of the perdition and the salvation of man.

Seg: Still more important for our purpose than the epic theme of the Reign of Yahweh is the theme of the oriental king who wages war in the name of God against the common enemies of God, of his anointed, and of his chosen people. It is here, as we have seen, that the evil of history is linked with cosmic evil, the Enemy representing the outcropping, in history, of the primordial Peril. The cosmic drama becomes a Messianic drama: “Why do the heathen rage, ,and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth rise up, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed. . . .” But Yahweh, in his wrath, speaks to them: “I myself have set my king upon Zion, my holy mountain. . . And to his king he says: “Thou shalt break them with a sceptre of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel” (Ps. 2). To David, “his servant,” Yahweh says again in Psalm 89: “The enemy shall not deceive him, nor the son of wickedness afflict him. And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. ...” Have we not here a recollection of the “cultual-ritual” combat of the god-king? Is not the historical enemy the primordial enemy of God and the king? Is not the Ling himself chosen "from the beginning,” at the time when chaos was overcome? AssociationValue: 0.4415992099457959


Seg: In the first place, it means accepting the fact that it is a myth. We shall say further on how Jewish thought could "work out this chronicle of a first human pair; but it must be well understood from the outset that, for the modern man who has learned the distinction between myth and history, this chronicle of the first man and the first pair can no longer be co-ordinated with the time of history and the space of geography as these have been irreversibly constituted by critical awareness. It must be well understood that the question, Where and when did Adam eat the forbidden fruit?, no longer has meaning for us; every effort to save the letter of the story as a true history is vain and hopeless. What we know, as men of science, about the beginnings of mankind leaves no place for such a primordial event. I am convinced that the full accept- AssociationValue: 0.432471642873295


Seg: This way of understanding is supported by the historical experience of the Jewish people. So far is the Adamic myth from being the point of departure for their experience of sin and guilt that it presupposes that experience and marks its maturity. That is why it was possible to understand the experience and to interpret its fundamental symbols—deviation, revolt, going astray, perdition, captivity—without recourse to that myth. Our problem will be to understand what the “Adamic” myth adds to those first symbols. In every way the addition is belated and, in certain respects, nonessential, as the history of Hebrew literature superabundantly proves. Adam is not an important figure in the Old Testament: the Prophets ignore him, various texts do, indeed, name Adam (subject of a verb in the plural) and the sons of Adam, but without allusion to the story of the fall; Abraham, the father of believers, and Noah, the father of mankind as recreated after the flood, are more important figures; and even for the editor of the account in Genesis it is not certain that Adam bears the entire responsibility for the evil in the world; he is perhaps only the first example of evil.

Seg: <83> I subscribe whole-heartedly to the view of C. H. Dodd, The Bible Today (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1946): “Thus the stories with which the Bible begins may be regarded as adaptations of primitive myths by writers who used them as symbols of truths learned in history. Nominally they refer to pre-history. In fact, they apply the principles of divine action revealed in the history of a particular people to mankind at all times and in all places. They universalize the idea of the Word of God, which is both judgement and renewal” (p. 115). AssociationValue: 0.6275819615313015


Seg: Thus, in his past, when he thinks back on it, the Israelite finds: a sign of hope; even before any eschatology he represents the history! of his “fathers” to himself as a history directed by a "promise” and-moving toward a “fulfillment.” No doubt that hope is dependent! on Land and Blood: You shall possess a land, the Promised Land,!
