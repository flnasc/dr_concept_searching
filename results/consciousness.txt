Seg: nevertheless that confession lies within the sphere of interest of philosophy, for it is an utterance, an utterance of man about himself; and every utterance can and must be taken up into the element of philosophic discourse. We shall indicate presently the philosophic locus, so to speak, of this “re-enactment/ which is no longer religious experience and which is not yet philosophy. But let us indicate first what is said in the utterance that we have called the confession of the evil in man by the religious consciousness. AssociationValue: 0.6096079683495135


Seg: Moreover, this experience is complex. Instead of the simple experience that one might expect, the confession of sins reveals several layers of experience. “Guilt,” in the precise sense of a feeling of the unworthiness at the core of one’s personal being, is only the advanced point of a radically individualized and interiorized experience. This feeling of guilt points to a more fundamental experience, the experience of “sin,” which includes all men and indicates the real situation of man before God, whether man knows it or not. It is this sin of which the myth of the fall recounts the entry into the world and which speculation on original sin attempts to erect into a doctrine. But sin, in its turn, is a correction and even a revolution with respect to a more archaic conception of fault— the notion of “defilement” conceived in the guise of a strain or blemish that infects from without, Guilt, sin, and defilement thus constitute a primitive diversity in experience. Hence, the feeling involved is not only blind in virtue of being emotional, it is also equivocal, laden with a multiplicity of meanings. This is why language is needed a second time to elucidate the subterranean crises of the consciousness of fault. AssociationValue: 0.3214426726108042


Seg: Now, the Hebraic and Hellenic literatures give evidence of a linguistic inventiveness that marks the existential eruptions of this consciousness of fault. It is by discovering the motivations of those linguistic inventions that we re-enact the passage from defilement to sin and guilt. Thus, the Hebrew and Greek words that express the consciousness of fault have a sort of wisdom of their own which we must make explicit and take as our guide in the labyrinth of living experience. We are not, therefore, reduced to the ineffable when we try to dig beneath the myths of evil, we still come up with a language. AssociationValue: 0.6368860673646396


Seg: Hence, although we shall deal only with spoken symbols and, indeed, only symbols of the self, we must never forget that these symbols, which will appear to us as primary in comparison with the elaborated and intellectualized formations of the consciousness of self, are already on the way to cutting themselves loose from the cosmic roots of symbolism. The movement that we shall follow from the symbolism of defilement to the symbolism of sin, and then to the symbolism of guilt properly so-called, is at the same time a progressive movement away from the cosmic ground of symbolism. The symbolism of defilement is still immersed in the cosmic; the subterranean equivalences and correspondences between the defiled, the consecrated, and the sacred are perhaps ineffaceable. It is the hierophanies, as a sphere of reality, that first engender the “onto- AssociationValue: 0.49216629113425037


Seg: A second source of neo-formations in our memory comes from later modifications of the “distance” between the sources of our consciousness. The science of religion “brings together” cultures that have not encountered each other. But these “bringings together” remain arbitrary insofar as no bonds are formed such as' engender great works of the sort that renew our patrimony, as was the case between the Hebrew and Greek cultures, which effectively encountered each other in a way that was decisive for the constitution of our memory. But there are cultures which have been brought together only in the mind of the scholar, but which have not yet encountered each other to the point of radically transforming our tradition; this is the case with the Far Eastern civilizations, This explains why a phenomenology oriented by the philosophical question of Greek origin cannot do justice to the great experiences of India and China. Here, not only the contingency but also the limits of our tradition become evident. There is a moment when the principle of orientation becomes a principle of limitation. It will be said, not without reason, that those civilizations are of equal value with the Greek and Jewish civilizations. But the point of view from which this equality of value can be seen does not yet exist, and it will exist eventually only when a universal human culture has AssociationValue: 0.5237455519384737


Seg: Is it possible to “re-enact” this sense of defilement? Its irrational character permits only an oblique approach. In the first stage of our investigation we shall make use of ethnological science without being concerned to appropriate its content; defilement will then appear to us as a moment of consciousness that we have left behind. Thus we understand through contrast the feelings and the behavior that we have abandoned. But this frontier view of the world of defilement can prepare the way, in a second stage, for a less remote understanding of those aspects of defilement that made it ready to be left behind. It is here that we shall bring into the account the symbolic richness of this experience of fault; for it is in virtue of its unlimited potentiality for symbolization that we still cling to it. We shall have approached as close as possible to an experience which has not simply been left behind but has been retained, and which perhaps conceals something that cannot be left behind, by which it survives through a thousand mutations. AssociationValue: 0.986762556722079


Seg: It is from a double point of view that defilement appears to us as a moment in the consciousness of fault that has been left behind: from an objective point of view and from a subjective point of view. AssociationValue: 0.9437434358218547


Seg: defilements—the frog that leaps into the fire, the hyena that leaves its excrements in the neighborhood of a tent. Why . are we astonished? Because we do not find in these actions or events any point where we might insert a judgment of personal imputation, or even simply human imputation; we have to transport ourselves into a consciousness for which impurity is measured not by imputation to a responsible agent but by the objective violation of an interdict. AssociationValue: 0.5467256918165637


Seg: Thus one is struck by the importance and the gravity attached to the violation of interdictions of a sexual character in the economy of defilement. The prohibitions against incest, sodomy, abortion, relations at forbidden times-—-and sometimes places—are so fundamental that the inflation of the sexual is characteristic of the whole system of defilement, so that an indissoluble complicity between sexuality and defilement seems to have been formed from time immemorial. This preponderance of sexual interdictions becomes very strange when it is compared with the two other characteristics described above: the extension of interdiction to actions morally neutral and the silence of the same ritual codes with regard to lying, theft} and sometimes homicide. This convergence of traits reveals that the defilement of sexuality as such is a theme foreign to the ethics that proceeds from the confession of divine holiness, as well as to the ethics that is organized around the theme of justice or the integrity of the moral person. The defilement of sexuality is a belief that is pre-ethical in character; it can become ethical, as the defilement of the murderer can become ethical in becoming an offense against the reciprocity of the human bond, although it precedes any ethics of the second person and is immersed in the archaic belief in the maleficent virtues of shed blood. The comparison between sexuality and murder is supported by the same play of images: in both cases, impurity is connected with the presence of a material "something” that transmits itself by contact and contagion. We shall say presently what there is in the consciousness of defilement that resists a literal, realistic, even materialistic interpretation of impure contact. If, from the beginning, defilement were not a symbolic stain, it would be incomprehensible that the ideas of defilement and purity could be corrected and taken up into an interpersonal ethics that puts the accent on the acquisitive or obla-tive aspects of sexuality—in short, on the quality of the relation to another. Nevertheless, by many of its traits sexuality supports the ambiguity of a quasi-materiality of defilement. At the limit, the infant Would be regarded as born impure, contaminated from the beginning by the paternal seed, by the impurity of the maternal AssociationValue: 0.4123902461627804


Seg: genital region, and by the additional impurity of childbirth. It is not certain that such beliefs do not continue to prowl in the consciousness of modem man and that they have not played a decisive role in speculation on original sin. Indeed, not only does this notion remain dependent on the general imagery of contact and contagion, which it uses in speaking of the transmission of the primordial taint, but it is still magnetized by the theme of sexual defilement considered as pre-eminently the impure. <2> AssociationValue: 0.9749947827268514


Seg: This limiting interpretation, which pulls sexual defilement in the direction of a material impurity, is re-enforced by the spectacle of rites of purification which, here as everywhere else, have the negative significance of an exemption from defilement. Do not the marriage rites, among others, aim to remove the universal impurity of sexuality by marking out an enclosure within which sexuality ceases to be a defilement, but threatens to become so again if the rules concerning times, places, and sexual behavior are not observed? At the end of this line on which we have just encountered the theme of the primordial defilement of sexuality, there appears the identity of purity and virginity: virginity and spotlessness are as closely bound together as sexuality and contamination. This double assonance is in the background of all our ethics, where it constitutes the archaism that is most resistant to criticism. So true is this that it is not from meditation on sexuality that a refinement of the consciousness of fault will be able to proceed, but from the non-sexual sphere of existence: from the human relations created by work, appropriation, politics. It is there that an ethics of relations to others will be formed, an ethics of justice and love, capable of turning back toward sexuality, of re-evaluating and transvaluing it, AssociationValue: 0.4204924216894599


Seg: By this second trait, again, the consciousness of impurity seems to be a moment inaccessible to any re-enactment in imagination and sympathy, a moment that has been abolished by the progress of moral consciousness itself. Nevertheless, that dread contains in germ all the later moments, because it conceals within itself the secret of its own passing; for it is already ethical dread and not merely physical fear, dread of a danger which is itself ethical and which, at a higher level of the consciousness of evil, will be the danger of not being able to love any more, the danger of being a dead man in the realm of ends. AssociationValue: 0.6837961091089135


Seg: The Hebrew example is still more striking. <4><5> Indeed, it might be alleged that the Greeks never attained the feeling of sin in its peculiar quality and with the intensity of which only the people of Israel supply an example, and that that is why the Greeks had no other recourse than to “transpose philosophically” the schema of defilement. It must still be shown just why the theme of the pure and the impure could lend itself to such a transposition. The Hebrew experience makes the question even more urgent. It is not only ritual legislation that preserves the belief in defilement in Israel; even the experience of sin itself, the profound originality of which in comparison with the experience of defilement we shall show further on, is expressed in the old language of defilement. Thus, the prophet Isaiah, at the time of his vision in the Temple, cries: “Woe is me! I am undone. For I am a man of unclean lips . . . and mine eyes have seen the King, Yahweh Sabaoth.” And after the seraph had touched his lips with the live coal from the altar: “Behold, this hath touched thy lips,—thy sin is taken away, —thine iniquity is expiated” (Is, 6:5, 7). Later, in the confession which is attributed after the event to David and which we shall cite further on in the framework not only of the consciousness of sin but of the feeling of guilt, the psalmist entreats: “Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness; according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my sin. Wash me from all iniquity; cleanse me from my fault, . . . O God, create in me a pure heart” (Ps. 51). The theme of defilement must be very strong and very, rich to have thus survived the magical and ritual conception that was its first vehicle. AssociationValue: 0.992103738856006


Seg: But this appeal to a just punishment still does not express all that is implicit in primitive anxiety. To be punished, even justly, is still suffering; every punishment is a penalty; every penalty is afflictive, if not in the technical sense that it has received in our codes, at least in the affective sense of the word. Punishment afflicts; punishment is of the order of pain or sorrow. In demanding that a man suffer justly, we expect the pain to have not only a limit, but a direction—that is to say, an end. We said above that the Sacred is perceived, in the archaic stage of the religious consciousness, as that which does not permit a man to stand, that which makes him die. And yet this negation is not self-enclosed. The very idea of vengeance conceals something else; to avenge is not only to destroy, but by destroying to re-establish. Along with the dread of being stricken, annihilated, there is perception of the movement by which order—whatever order it may be—is restored. That which had been established and which has now been destroyed is re-established. By negation, order reaffirms itself. AssociationValue: 0.6346109978744707


Seg: But is a human existence entirely freed from negative feelings possible? The abolition of fear appears to me to be only the most distant goal of ethical consciousness. The change of rule which leads from fear of vengeance to love of order, the principal episode of which we shall consider presently with the Hebraic notion of the Covenant, does not simply abolish fear, but takes it over and remakes it in a new range of feeling, AssociationValue: 0.9756726484004086


Seg: man, It is3 then, the prior establishment of the bond of the Covenant that is important for the consciousness of sin; it is this that makes sin a violation of the Covenant, AssociationValue: 0.9099840316715431


Seg: That the reform of Josiah had brought a false security into the consciousness of sin is sufficiently evidenced by the disconcerting, scandalous behavior of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Those who had satisfied the cultual demands of the deuteronomic reform might nourish a legitimate confidence in the face of the storm that broke over Judah. But here is Jeremiah taking up the howling of Amos: "You shall be destroyed because of your sins.” His non-resistance which presides over the theological unity of the book, covers, then, all Yahweh’s interventions and tends to raise to a “didactic” level what first appears as a liturgical unity. It is within this whole that one must place the exhortations (Chaps. 6-11) and the body of laws (Chaps. 12 ff.), which, moreover, sound homiletic rather than juridical, in the style of preaching. The legalistic and cultual aspect then gets a new meaning, polemical and militant, directed against the Canaanitish nature-religion. Finally, one must never lose sight of the fact that all these imperatives are motivated by the recognition of the gratuitous and merciful election of Israel by its God, who loved it first. Even the situation in which Deuteronomy is supposed to be proclaimed by Moses is full of symbolic meaning: between Egypt and Canaan, between the going out and the coming in, between the promise and the fulfillment—that spiritual “moment” is the moment of the Torah. AssociationValue: 0.7143668281035808


Seg: This political “nihilism” is essential to the Hebraic consciousness of sin; it is, in fact, the expression of a pedagogy of historical failure that aims at placing the ethical demand beyond any assignable historical end, beyond any finite observance, beyond any self-justification. The deuteronomic spirit, then, is only an episode between the terrible preaching of Justice by Amos and the defeatism in which Jeremiah and Ezekiel mask their unlimited demand for selfabandonment to the absolute of Yahweh. AssociationValue: 0.43562985664443515


Seg: Shifting our gaze from the “objective” to the “subjective” pole of the consciousness of sin, we are now led back to the threat and the fear that we provisionally placed within brackets in order to consider the ethical content of the indignation of the prophet, namely, the balance between the infinite demand and the finite commandment, As was said above, it is not possible, in Hebrew prophecy, to separate Wrath from Indignation, Terror from Accusation.	- AssociationValue: 0.33849188245257894


Seg: It is necessary, therefore, to look this enigma in the face: in rising from the consciousness of defilement to the consciousness of sin, fear and anguish did not disappear; rather, they changed their quality. It is this new quality of anguish that constitutes what we call the “subjective” pole of the consciousness of sin. Perhaps we can understand the sense of this specific sort of anguish if we place it in relation with, the two characteristics of sin studied above— the “before God” and “the infinite demand”—or, in other words, if we place it within the Covenant, and if we see therein a dramatization of the dialogal relation that is constitutive of the Covenant. AssociationValue: 0.4823103357228018


Seg: concerns the political fate of the community of Israel. This point is of capital importance and dominates to a great extent the distinction between sin and guilt that will be introduced later on. Guilt represents an internalization and a personalization of the consciousness of sin. This double operation will encounter the resistance of the historical and communal interpretation of sin which found in the theme of the Wrath of God and the Day of Yahweh its most powerful symbol. In fact, it is as a people that Israel feels itself threatened through the mouth of the prophet; it is by the roundabout way of a theology of history, of an oracle concerning the future of the community, that the people feels itself condemned. Historical failure is thus erected into a symbol of condemnation. AssociationValue: 0.3031530970338383


Seg: The moment has come to consider in a more systematic manner the linguistic creations that correspond to this new cycle of experience. We shall take for reference the symbolism of defilement worked out at the preceding stage of the consciousness of fault. It was, we remember, the representation of a something, of a positive power, that infects and contaminates by contact; even if those representations are not to be taken literally, but symbolically, nevertheless the secondary intention that runs through the literal sense of stain indicates the positive character of defilement and the negative character of purity. This is why the symbolism of defilement was necessarily shattered under the pressure of a new experience and gave way little by little to a new symbolism. If sin is primarily the rupture of a relation, it becomes difficult to express it in terms of defilement. We shall look for the trail of this conversion from positive to negative in the vocabulary of sin. AssociationValue: 0.6218528673666375


Seg: This “realism” of sin will not be fully understood until it is approached through the new factor in the consciousness of fault that we shall call guilt. Strictly speaking, it is only with this new moment that the consciousness of sin becomes the criterion and the measure AssociationValue: 0.6085675867775494


Seg: It is not so with the “confession” of sin “confession” is the frontier view of a real evil that has been revealed and denounced by the prophetic summons and that is not measured by the sinner’s consciousness of it. This is why the “reality” of sin—one might even say the ontological dimension of sin—must be contrasted with the “subjectivity” of the consciousness of guilt. It is the “heart” of man that is evil—that is to say, his very existence, whatever his consciousness of it may be. AssociationValue: 0.6252847105647981


Seg: does unwittingly any of the things that are forbidden by the commandments of Yahweh, he shall be responsible and shall bear the weight of his fault” (Lev. 5:17). But the explanation of these examples by some survival of the system of taboo, sacrilege, and ritual expiation must not conceal the more important fact that makes this survival possible, namely, that the Law, as the ethico-juridical expression of the Covenant, has been substituted for the anonymous power of taboo and the automatism of its vengeance, and establishes a hypersubjective reference for sin. It is finally the “real” situation of man within the Covenant that is the measure of sin and confers upon it a genuine transcendence in relation to the consciousness of guilt. AssociationValue: 0.4570708910781041


Seg: Because it is the possible truth of the knowledge of oneself, this Seeing preserves the reality of my existence beyond the consciousness that I have of it, and more particularly the reality of sin beyond the feeling of guilt. AssociationValue: 0.625885223453252


Seg: Two reasons determine our resistance to this reduction of fault to guilt. In the first place, guilt, considered by itself, leads in several directions: in the direction of an ethico-juridical reflection on the relation of penalty to responsibility; in the direction of an ethico-religious reflection on a delicate and scrupulous conscience; and finally, in the direction of a psycho-theological reflection on the hell of an accused and condemned conscience. Penal rationalization in the Greek manner, internalization and refinement of ethical awareness in the Judaic manner, consciousness of the wretchedness of man under the regime of the Law and of the works of the Law in the Paulinian manner—these are three divergent possibilities which the notion of guilt carries. Now, it is not possible to understand directly the intimate connection among these three aspects of guilt, which are in constant opposition,.two by two: the rationality of the Greek against the religiosity of the Jew and the Christian; the internality of “piety” against the externality of the city or of salvation by grace; Paulinian antilegalism against the law of the tribunal and against Mosaic law. All the rest of this chapter will be entirely devoted to this splintering of the idea of guilt. But to be able to perceive this internal dialectic of guilt, one must set it in a vaster dialectic, that of the three moments of fault: defilement, sin, guilt. AssociationValue: 0.5821793592859343


Seg: It can be said, in very general terms, that guilt designates the subjective moment in fault as sin is its ontological moment. Sin designates the real situation of man before God, whatever consciousness he may have of it, This situation must be discovered in the proper sense of the word: the Prophet is the man capable of announcing to the King that his power is weak and vain. Guilt is the awareness of this real situation, and, if one may say so, the “for itself” of this kind of “in itself.” AssociationValue: 0.6100583020499509


Seg: ment and to make oneself the subject of the chastisement. It is in this sense, and this sense only, that guilt is already implied in defilement. No doubt we can say that this guilt is already responsibility, if we mean that being responsible is being capable of answering for the consequences of an act; but this consciousness of responsibility is only an appendage of the consciousness of being charged with the weight of punishment in anticipation; it does not proceed from a consciousness of being the author of. .. . The sociology of responsibility is very illuminating at this point; man had the consciousness of responsibility before having the consciousness of being cause, agent, author. It is his situation in relation to interdictions that first makes him responsible. AssociationValue: 0.3218815156383427


Seg: Let the “I” be emphasized more than the “before thee,” let the “before thee” be even forgotten, and the consciousness of fault becomes guilt and no longer sin at all; it is “conscience” that now becomes the measure of evil in a completely solitary experience. It is not by accident that in many languages the same word designates moral consciousness (conscience morale), and psychological and reflective consciousness; guilt expresses above all the promotion of “conscience” as supreme. AssociationValue: 0.673831571616841


Seg: Thus the tension between the “realism” of sin and the “phenomenalism” of guilt has as its first corollai’y the individualization of imputation. A new opposition arises in the consciousness of fault: according to the schema of sin, evil is a situation “in which” mankind' is caught as a single collective; according to the schema AssociationValue: 0.5442427641593749


Seg: The first direction in which the consciousness of guilt moves is, then, that of our ethico-juridical experience. The metaphor of the tribunal, we shall see, invades all registers of the consciousness of guilt. But before being a metaphor of the moral consciousness, the tribunal is a real institution of the city, and this institution was the channel by which the religious consciousness of sin was reformed. In what sense? AssociationValue: 0.703475193597372


Seg: ' of the Sophists, of Plato, of Aristotle—in which it is both reflected and modified. Besides, its relations with tragedy keep it in proximity not only with philosophy but with antiphilosophy. Finally, the elaboration of the Greek vocabulary of guilt in connection with the determination of penalties is an immense cultural event: the adventure of r/?pu, dfidpTqfxa, dfWa is the adventure of our own conscience, the conscience of men of the West; even the Bible has influenced our culture through the Greek translation. Now, the choice of Greek equivalents for Biblical sin and for all the ethico-religious concepts of Hebrew origin is in itself a decision about the meaning of our symbols; on this level we are indivisibly Greeks and Jews. Thus, the elaboration of the concepts of guilt through the juridical and penal experience of the Greeks is more than the simple history of the penal institutions of classical Greece, and belongs to that history of the ethico-religious consciousness, the principal motivations of which we are here tracing. AssociationValue: 0.34855411726268676


Seg: The contribution of the Greeks to this third stage in the consciousness of fault differs profoundly from the contribution of the Jews in virtue of the role played in it by the direct application of reflection to the city, to its legislation, and to the organization of penal law. Here it is not a Covenant, ethical monotheism, a per- AssociationValue: 0.5335103317676418


Seg: sonalistic relation between God and man that raises the counterpole of an accused subjectivity; it is the ethics of a city of men that constitutes the focus of a reasonable indictment. Of course, this process still evolves on the fringes of religious consciousness; the city remains a “holy” magnitude; its charge of sacredness in the classical epoch remains such that injustice is still synonymous with impiety. Inversely, impiety and even impurity were never spoken of in Greece without reference to injustice. Whichever one you start with, the three factors of purity, holiness, and justice constantly encroach upon one another at the height of the classical epoch. It must be said that the passage from one to the other was never marked, in the Hellenic consciousness, by crises comparable to the crisis produced in Israel by prophetic preaching; the taste of the poets and, above all, of the tragedians for archaic situations, the literary and theatrical revival of the old myths of defilement and purification, make the interferences among the various notions even more inextricable. It must be acknowledged that if we had only the testimony of Greece, we could never reach even a slightly coherent idea of the typological succession of defilement, sin, and guilt. AssociationValue: 0.3842858942113102


Seg: Thus, the notion of d&wtv, often taken abstractly in the sense of committing an injustice and also of being unjust, marks the emergence of a purely moral notion of evil outside the sinister operation of impurity. But injustice, like justice itself, thrusts its roots down into the archaic consciousness of the impure and the pure. It was Slur) which, in becoming rationalized, established the rationality of the aMn-qua. This rationality consisted essentially in a division between Cosmos and City. The same justice, the same injustice, the same expiation which, in the fragment of Anaximander, were categories of the Whole of nature as the totality of being “according to the order of time,” became crystallized into something solely human by settling down upon the civic AssociationValue: 0.45003330507628564


Seg: The second direction in which the consciousness of guilt breaks out is that of the delicate and scrupulous conscience. Adhering to our practice of capturing each of the most fundamental possibilities of experience in an especially clear example, we do not hesitate to seek in Pharisaism both the birthplace of this modality of consciousness and the summit of its perfection. AssociationValue: 0.6852802929036063


Seg: The "curse of the law” reveals the meaning of the whole prior development of the consciousness of fault. To understand this point, let us go back not only to the Pharisees, but to the core of the notion of guilt. Guilt, we have said, is the completed internalization of sin, With guilt, "conscience” is bom; a responsible agent appears, to face the prophetic call and its demand for holiness. But with the factor of "conscience” man the measure likewise comes into being; the realism of sin, measured by the eye of God, is absorbed into the phenomenalism of the guilty conscience, which is the measure' of itself. If this analysis is brought to the light of the Pauline experience of justification by the works of the law, it appears that the promotion of guilt—with its acute sense of individual responsibility, its taste for degrees and nuances in imputation, its moral tact—is at the same time the advent of self-righteousness and the curse attached thereto. Simultaneously, the experience of scrupulousness itself undergoes a radical re-interpretation: that in it which had not been felt as fault, becomes fault; the attempt to reduce sin by observance becomes sin. That is the real meaning of the curse of the law. AssociationValue: 0.7370760188813305


Seg: is itself manifold. In the first place, it consists in the atomization of the law in a multitude of commandments. This phenomenon is very ambiguous; for it was already present in the dialectics of the prophetic accusation which, by turns, summons man to a total and indivisible perfection and itemizes his wickedness according to the many dimensions of his existence for himself and for others, and according to the many spheres in which he acts—worship, politics, marriage, trade, hospitality, etc. But under the regime of sin, the tension between radical demand and ,differentiated prescription is preserved, and the principal emphasis falls on the radical demand. With the consciousness of guilt, the equilibrium is destroyed, to the advantage of the differentiated prescription; an indefinite enumeration is substituted for the radicalness of the infinite demand, and from this multiplication of commandments there comes an indictment that is itself indefinite. We might call this indefinite enumeration and indictment, which make the law “accursed,” an “evil infinite.” AssociationValue: 0.4398463424259818


Seg: The "Adamic” myth is the fruit of the prophetic accusation directed against man; the same theology that makes God innocent accuses man. Now that accusation, .more and more integrated and assimilated into the consciousness of the Jew, developed into a spirit of repentance, the depth of which we have seen in our study of sin and guilt, The Jew repents not only for his actions, but for AssociationValue: 0.5379564409470681


Seg: AT THE END of our double approach—through the abstract description of fallibility and through the “re-enactment” of the religious consciousness of fault—the question arises: How shall we continue? AssociationValue: 0.9357056941523917
