Topic: 9
Seg: Not that any culture is excluded in principle; but in this area oriented by the originally Greek question, there are relations of “proximity” and “distance” that belong inescapably to the structure of our cultural memory, Hence the privilege of “proximity” of the Greek and Jewish cultures; these two cultures, which would contain nothing exceptional for an eye not situated anywhere in particular, constitute the first stratum of our philosophical memory. More precisely, the encounter of the Jewish source with the Greek origin is the fundamental intersection that founds our culture. The Jewish source is the first “other” of philosophy, its “nearest” other; the abstractly contingent fact of that encounter is the very fate of our occidental existence. Since our existence begins with it> this encounter has become necessary, in the sense that it is the presupposition of our undeniable reality. This is why the history of the consciousness of fault in Greece and in Israel will constantly be our central point of reference; it is our “nearest” origin, in this spiritual economy of distance. AssociationValue: 0.9876692994221096


Seg: “Relations in depth” first. There are themes of the religious consciousness that appear to us today, as it were, in the “thickness” and the transparency of our present motivations. The conception of fault as defilement is the best example of this; it shows through all our Greek and Hebrew documents. It is impossible to overestimate the importance of this stratified structure for the consciousness of fault. Psychoanalysis, it will be seen, tries to make a logical archaism coincide with this cultural “distance.” It is to elucidate this sedimentation of our cultural memory that we can appeal to documents bearing on civilizations which do not belong to that memory—civilizations of Africa, Australia, Asia, etc.—and which are quite often contemporary civilizations. The objective likeness that ethnology discovers between them and our own past authorizes us to use knowledge about those civilizations to diagnose our own past, suppressed or buried in oblivion. It is solely in virtue of their diagnostic value in relation to our memory that we shall invoke the testimony of ethnology concerning modes of behavior and consciousness of fault.	.

Seg: But one cannot explicate these relations in “depth” in the bosom of our memory without bringing the “lateral” relations to light also. For example, it is impossible today to understand the Hebrew source without placing its beliefs and its institutions in the framework of the culture of the ancient Middle East, for it repeats some of the fundamental themes of that culture (by direct borrowing, by reference to common sources, or in virtue of the parallelism of material and cultural conditions), and above all it modifies some others profoundly. The understanding of those likenesses and unlikenesses pertains henceforth to the proper understanding of the Hebrew source of our memory, so that the culture of the ancient Middle East itself belongs marginally to our memory.

Seg: In their turn, these relations in “depth” and in “breadth” are reshaped by retroactive relations. Our cultural memory is unceasingly renewed retroactively by new discoveries, returns to the sources, reforms and renaissances that are much more than revivals of the past and constitute behind us what one might call a “neopast.” Thus, our Hellenism is not exactly the Hellenism of the Alexandrians, or of the Church Fathers, or of Scholasticism, or of the Renaissance, or of the Aufkldrung; think, for example, of the rediscovery of tragedy by the moderns. Thus, by retroaction from the successive “nows,” our past never stops changing its meaning; the present appropriation of the past modifies that which motivates us from the depths of the past, AssociationValue: 0.41700037236077403


Seg: That such intermediaries have been lost is a part of the situation of our memory; but suddenly their restoration transforms the understanding that we had of ourselves on the basis of that past full of lacunae. Thus, the discovery of manuscripts in the desert of Judea restores an important transition in the Judeo-Ghristian past. Now, the ignorance of that transition was part of the motivations of our consciousness up to a recent date; the present discoveries reshape the established tradition, throw light on obscure motivations, and thus give us a new memory.

Seg: A second source of neo-formations in our memory comes from later modifications of the “distance” between the sources of our consciousness. The science of religion “brings together” cultures that have not encountered each other. But these “bringings together” remain arbitrary insofar as no bonds are formed such as' engender great works of the sort that renew our patrimony, as was the case between the Hebrew and Greek cultures, which effectively encountered each other in a way that was decisive for the constitution of our memory. But there are cultures which have been brought together only in the mind of the scholar, but which have not yet encountered each other to the point of radically transforming our tradition; this is the case with the Far Eastern civilizations, This explains why a phenomenology oriented by the philosophical question of Greek origin cannot do justice to the great experiences of India and China. Here, not only the contingency but also the limits of our tradition become evident. There is a moment when the principle of orientation becomes a principle of limitation. It will be said, not without reason, that those civilizations are of equal value with the Greek and Jewish civilizations. But the point of view from which this equality of value can be seen does not yet exist, and it will exist eventually only when a universal human culture has AssociationValue: 0.4673639914739754


Seg: brought all cultures together in a whole. In the meantime, neither the history of religions nor philosophy can be a concrete universal capable of embracing all human experience. On the one hand, the objectivity of science, without a point of view and without situation, does not equalize cultures except by neutralizing their value; it cannot think the positive reasons for their equal value. On the other hand, philosophy, as we have received it from the Greeks and perpetuated it in the West, will remain unequal to this concrete universal as long as no serious encounter and no mutual clarification have brought these civilizations into the field of our experience and at the same time removed its limitation. This encounter and this mutual clarification have not yet really taken place. They have taken place for some men and some groups and they have been the great concern of their lives; but they have remained episodic for our culture as a whole. This is why, up to the present, they have not had the significance of a foundation (as did the encounter of the Greek question with the Hebrew religion) and of a re-creation (as have the various renaissances and returns to sources in the bosom of Western culture). Their phenomenological character is precisely that they have remained episodic, and so the relation of our culture to the Far East remains a relation to something distant. No doubt we are drawing closer to the moment of a creative encounter and the reshaping of a memory based on the opposition of “near” and “far”; but we are not in a position to imagine what that will mean for the categories of our ontology and for our reading of the Pre-Socratics, Greek tragedy, and the Bible. But one thing is certain: we shall not enter into this great debate of each culture with all without our memory; the lessening of the distance between our civilization and those which today we still call “distant” will not suppress the structuration of our memory, but will complicate it. It will not cease to be true that we were born to philosophy by Greece and that as philosophers we have encountered the Jews before encountering the Hindus and the Chinese.
