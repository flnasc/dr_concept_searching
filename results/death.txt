Seg: This breadth and this narrowness give evidence of a stage in which evil and misfortune have not been dissociated, in which the ethical order of doing ill has not been distinguished from the cosmo-biological order of faring ill: suffering, sickness, death, failure. We shall see after a while how the anticipation of punishment, at the heart of the fear of the impure, strengthens this bond between evil and misfortune: punishment falls on man in the guise of misfortune and transforms all possible sufferings, all diseases, all death, all failure into a sign of defilement. Thus the world of defilement embraces in its order of the impure the consequences of impure actions or events; step by step, there is nothing that cannot be pure or impure. Hence, the division between the pure and the impure ignores any distinction between the physical and the ethical and follows a distribution of the sacred and the profane which has become irrational for us. AssociationValue: 0.9808471233972069


Seg: man suffers because he is impure, then God is innocent. Thus the world of ethical terror holds in reserve one of the most tenacious “rationalizations” of the evil of suffering, That is why it required nothing less than the calling in question of this first rationalization and the crisis of which the Babylonian Job and the Hebrew Job were the admirable witnesses to dissociate the ethical world of sin from the physical world of suffering. This dissociation has been one of the greatest sources of anguish for the human conscience, for suffering has had to become absurd and scandalous in order that sin might acquire its strictly spiritual meaning. At this terrible price, the fear that was attached to it could become fear of not loving enough and could be dissociated from the fear of suffering and failure; in short, the fear of spiritual death could be divorced from the fear of physical death. This conquest was a costly one. The price to be paid was the loss of a first rationalization, a first explanation of suffering. Suffering had to become inexplicable, a scandalous evil, in order that the evil of defilement might become the evil of fault. The figure of the just man suffering, image and type of unjust suffering, constituted the stumbling block against which the premature rationalizations of misfortune were shattered. Henceforth, it will be impossible to co-ordinate doing evil and suffering evil in an immediate explanation. AssociationValue: 0.8486616533032028


Seg: Hence it is in the era before this crisis of the first rationalization, before the dissociation of misfortune (suffering, disease, death, failure) and fault that the dread of the impure deploys its anxieties: the prevention of defilement takes upon itself all fears and all sorrows; man, before any direct accusation, is already secretly accused of the misfortunes in the world; wrongly accused—thus does man appear to us at the origin of his ethical experience. AssociationValue: 0.7601286152740893


Seg: If one goes back still further, the shadow of punishment extends over the whole region and over the very source of the interdictions, and darkens the experience of the sacred. Seen from the point of view of the vengeance and the suffering anticipated in the interdiction, the sacred reveals itself as superhuman destruction of man; the death of man is inscribed in primordial purity. And so, in fearing defilement, man fears the negativity of the transcendent; the transcendent is that before which man cannot stand; no one cam see God—at least the god of taboos and interdicts—without dying. It is from this, from this wrath and this terror, this deadly power of retribution, that the sacred gets its character of separateness. It cannot be touched; for if it is touched—that is to say, violated—its death-dealing power is unleashed. AssociationValue: 0.7466417479154077


Seg: Dread of the impure is, in fact, no more a physical fear than defilement is a stain or spot. Dread of the impure is like fear, but already it faces a threat which, beyond the threat of suffering and death, aims at a diminution of existence, a loss of the personal core of one’s being.

Seg: <31>	Ed, Jacob attaches the sacrificial ritual to the themes of “buying back” and of “ransom,” and finds the common nucleus in the idea of substitution. He subordinates the symbolization of the death of the guilty one to the communication of divine life to the sinner: “thus the essence of the sacrifice is not the death of the victim, but the offering of his life” (op. ct'i., p. 237). In a neighboring sense, von Rad quotes Ohler, Theologie des alien Testaments: “In the sacrifice no act of punitive justice is performed, and the altar can in no way be compared to a tribunal.” Von Rad adds: “Expiation, then, is not a punitive act, but a method of salvation,” op. cit., p. 270. AssociationValue: 0.32950275900286813


Seg: tant to measure, although the novelty and the crisis issue from the deepening of the feeling of sin. On the one hand, the feeling of sin is a feeling of guilt; guiltiness is the burden of sin: it is the loss of the bond with the origin, insofar as that loss is felt. In this sense guilt is the achieved internality of sin. This internalization is the fruit of the deepening of the demand that is addressed to man. That deepening, we remember, is double: in becoming ethical and no longer only ritual, the Interdiction raises up a subjective pole of responsibility that can no longer be only one who answers for the sanction, one who is responsible in the elementary sense of a subject of punishment, but a center of decision, an author of acts. That is not all: the Interdiction not only passes from the ritual to the ethical; it becomes unlimited as the demand for perfection which goes beyond any enumeration of duties or virtues. This call to “perfection” reveals, behind acts, the depths of possible existence. In fact, just as man is called to a unique perfection that surpasses the multiplicity of his obligations, he is revealed to himself as the author not only of his many acts, but of the motives of his acts and, beyond the motives, of the most radical possibilities which are suddenly reduced to the pure and simple alternative: God or Nothing. We have previously evoked the “Deuteronomic choice”: “I have placed before you life and death; choose the good and you shall live.” This call to a radical choice raises up, over against itself, a subjective pole, a respondent, no longer in the sense of a bearer of punishment, but in the sense of an existent capable of embracing his whole life and considering it as one undivided destiny, hanging upon a simple alternative. Thus the prophetic call transformed the Covenant from a simple juridical contract between Yahweh and his people into a personal accusation and adjuration. There is henceforth an “I,” because there is a “thou” to whom the Prophet addresses himself in the name of God. AssociationValue: 0.3646753141798807


Seg: It is here that the hell of guilt begins. Not only is the road that leads to justice an endless one, but the law itself increases the distance, The great discovery of Paul is that the law itself is a source of sin: it “was added because of transgressions”; far from “giving life,” it can only “give knowledge of sin.” Indeed, it even begets sin. How? St. Paul, long before Nietzsche—who nevertheless thought he was blasting the first “theologian,”—dismounted the spring of that infernal machine. He compares Law and Sin, as two imagined entities, and reveals their deadly circularity; entering the vicious circle by way of the law, he writes: “The law entered in, that sin might abound. . . .” (Rom. 5:20); the commandment, when it came, “gave life to sin” and so “slew me” (7:9). But this first reading is the reverse of the other, the true one; it is sin that, “taking occasion,” makes use of the law to bestir itself and work concupiscence in me; it is sin that, “utilizing the law, seduced me and by its means slew me” (7:8, 11). Thus the law is that which exhibits sin, that which makes sin manifest: “It was sin which, in order that it might appear sin, made use of a good thing to procure death for me, in order that sin might exert all its sinful power through the commandment” (7:13).

Seg: in their hearts, and finally beyond the opposition between the good will of the Jew and the “wisdom” or “knowledge” of the Greek. The problem of the commandment arises beyond all these dichotomies, and it is this: how is it possible that the law, although good in itself and recognized as good by “the inward man” in his “understanding, which rejoices in it,” how is it possible that this law, meant to gain life, is converted into a “minister of condemnation,” a minister of death”? It is while he is working out the answer to this root question that St. Paul brings to light a dimension of sin, a new quality of evil, which is not the “transgression” of a definite commandment, nor even transgression at all, but the will to save oneself by satisfying the law—what Paul calls “justice of the law” or “justice that comes by the law.” Thus sin itself is carried beyond the opposition between concupiscence and zeal for the law. Paul calls this will to self-justification “boasting in the law.” By that he does not mean ordinary boasting, but the pretension of living in reliance on that which of right is meant to give life, but which in fact is condemned to lead to death. By this pretension, morality and immorality are henceforth included in the same existential category, which is called “flesh” (we shall return to this word further on), “desires of the flesh,” “care,” “fear,” “sorrows of this world”; all of these words denote the opposite of liberty, slavery, bondage to the “weak and beggarly elements.” AssociationValue: 0.4441166969567007


Seg: Finally, by this double generalization of the law and the flesh a new and radical sense of death itself is revealed. St, Paul is the heir of the Hebrew thesis according to which sin is punished by death; but through this penal and consequently extrinsic interpretation of death, he discerns a ministry of death exactly proportionate to that of the law. Death is the result of the law for a being who, aiming at life, misses it; it is the “fruit,” the “harvest” of the regime of existence that we have called sin, boasting, justification by the law, flesh: “to live according to the flesh” is death, just as “to mortify the deeds of the body” is “life” (Rom. 8:13). Thus the whole of existence, when it is placed under the law, becomes altogether. “the body of this death” (7:24): “For when we were dead in the flesh, the sinful passions that make use of the law did work in our members so that we might bring forth fruit unto death” (7:5).

Seg: What do we know of this death? In part, it is a death that does not know itself; it is the living death of those who believe themselves living. But in part, also, it is a death that is suffered: “When the commandment came, sin revived and I died” (Rom. 7:9-10). What shall we say? Without doubt it is legitimate to compare this death that is suffered with the experience of division and conflict described in the pericope of the Epistle to the Romans (7:14—19), which follows the dialectic of sin and the law reported above. Death, then, is the actualized dualism of the Spirit and the flesh. AssociationValue: 0.7031182203075262


Seg: 25	Perhaps it should be said that physical death itself is the “fruit” of gin—not, of course, merely as a biological event, but in the human character of dying, as an event in communal existence, and as the anguish of solitude. We shall come back to this in connection with the Adamic myth. AssociationValue: 0.4556173659688327


Seg: 27	This hell of guilt, engendered by the law and its curse, finds its supreme symbol in the Satanic figure itself. We know that the Devil was understood not only as the Tempter but as the Accuser of man at the last judgment (while Christ becomes the Advocate, the Paraclete). Thus the demon stands not only behind transgression, but behind the law itself, inasmuch as it is a law of death. AssociationValue: 0.5345905256586524


Seg: Its terrors are represented, before the grievous experience of the death of his friend, death in the second person, by the monster Huwawa, placed by the god in the midst of the cedar forest “as a terror to mortals”; the two friends must destroy him to exorcize their weakness: “Let us, me and thee, slay him, that all evil from the land we may banish!” (Ill, iii, 6-7). “Huwawa—his roaring is the flood-storm, his mouth is fire, his breath is death!” (Ill, iii, 18-20). And already Gilgamesh has a foreboding of the secret which he will have to take as the reason for his mortal life: AssociationValue: 0.588635525382058


Seg: Utriapishtim gives evidence only of an exceptional and incommunicable immortality, which makes the quest of Gilgamesh all the more distressing and absurd, The sorrowful hero is separated from the blessed hero by the abyss of sleep (XI, 200 ff,); and this sleep is also the harbinger of death (233-34), For Gilgamesh there is only one way: Return, return to finitude, to the city of Uruk, to toil and care. AssociationValue: 0.3310237231419451


Seg: The fault itself is part of a complex of misfortunes, to which death and birth contribute a note of contingency and ineluctability . that contaminates human action, so to speak, with their fatality. Man is essentially mortal, and his mortality is his lot; the pale and unsubstantial reality of the world of the dead heightens more than it weakens the character of mortality as an insurmountable obstacle; the gods, as powers brought to a focus in distinct and precise shapes, can do nothing about it. This note of impotence is reflected back from death upon birth, which is the first day of reckoning, the first fateful event; birth is represented on the model of death, and all of one’s destiny appears fated, beginning from its end. Thus the fatality of death and of birth haunts all our acts, which are thereby rendered impotent and irresponsible.

Seg: There is one exception, it is true, but one that confirms our interpretation indirectly. Sophocles too, in Oedipus at Golonus> hailed the end of the tragic ; the old Oedipus, after a long meditation on his misfortunes, is led by Sophocles to the threshold of a non-tragic death; he is removed from the sight of the profane, after having been accompanied by Theseus, the royal sacrificer, to the boundaries of the sacred territory of the city. Weinstock justly compared this sacred drama to a “legend of the saints”; but the death of the aged Oedipus, the glorious death of a hero grown wiser, is a suspension of the human condition rather than its cure.

Seg: human condition. The nakedness of the innocent pair and the shame that follows fault express the human mutation of all communication, marked henceforth by dissimulation. Work ceases to be joyous and becomes toilsome, placing man in an attitude of hostility toward nature. The pain of child-bearing darkens the joy of procreation. The conflict between the woman’s seed and the serpent’s symbolizes the militant and suffering condition of freedom, henceforth a prey to the guile of desires (compare with Genesis 4:7). Even death is altered: the curse is not that man shall die (“for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return”), but that he shall face death with the anguished awareness of its imminence; the curse is the human modality of dying.

Seg: For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. AssociationValue: 0.4022171678847013


Seg: Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good, Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. AssociationValue: 0.4885626106089928


Seg: It is the problem of the theologian, not of the philosopher, to’ understand what can be meant by the following two affirmations from the New Testament: at first, Jesus refers to himself in the third person by the title of Son of Man (Mark 13:26-27 is a direct echo of Daniel 7:13), and consequently the theme of the Son of Man gives the clew to the first Christology, that of Jesus himself; afterwards Jesus for the first time unites the idea of suffering and death, which had previously pertained to the theme of the servant of Yalnveh, with the figure of the Son of Man; thus he makes the theology of glory follow the road of the theology of the Gross, and profoundly transforms the function of the Judge (connected with the figure of the Son of Man) by bringing it into contact with the suffering of the “servant,” thereby making him both judge and advocate. That Jesus could be the point of convergence of all the figures without himself being a “figure” is an Event that exceeds the resources of our phenomenology of images. All the images we have examined are subject to our hermeneutic method insofar as they are scattered images, but their temporal and personal unity is not; the event announced in the Gospel, the “fulfillment,” is properly the content of the Christian Kerygma. <94> Hence, our exegesis of the figures stays on the hither side of the Christian Kerygma; this is possible because “no Christological title, no Christian concept was invented by Jesus or by the Christians.” <95><96> On the other hand, we can very well give an account of the enrichment that those fundamental images received from their being remolded by Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels and from their convergence in his own person.

Seg: in his time, usurped the name and the writings of Musaeus and Orpheus, speculated on this fear of punishment after death, “They call initiation those ceremonies which deliver us from the evils of the other world and which one cannot neglect without expecting dreadful torments” (Rep.j 364f). This speculation on the fear of the living surely does not exhaust the meaning of the preaching, which must have included, before it reached the decadence of Plato’s day, both an appeal to a purity that was moral rather than ritual, as Plato himself understood it in the Phaedo, and also concern for a punishment which would fall upon the guilty and not upon the innocent, as commonly happens in this life.

Seg: That is why tragedy has never finished dying. Killed twice, by the philosophical Logos and by the Judeo-Ghristian Kerygma, it survived its double death. The theme of the wrath of God, the ultimate motive of the tragic consciousness, is invincible to the arguments of the philosopher as well as of the theologian. For there is no rational vindication of the innocence of God; every explanation of the Stoic or Leibnizian type is wrecked, like the naive arguments of Job’s friends, on the suffering of the innocent. They leave intact the opacity of evil and the opacity of the world in which such a thing is possible,” as Max Scheler says in his essay on the “Phenomenon of the Tragic”; as soon as meaninglessness appears to swoop down intentionally on man, the schema of the wrath of God looms up and the tragic consciousnes is restored. Only a consciousness that had accepted suffering without reservation could also begin to absorb the Wrath of God into the Love of God; but even then the suffering of others, the suffering of children, of the lowly, would renew the mystery of iniquity in his eyes.T Only timid hope could anticipate in silence the end of the phantasm of the “wicked God.” AssociationValue: 0.3116273356583942
