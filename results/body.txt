Seg: although sin is said to “reign” in his members, “in his mortal body” (Rom. 6:12), and the body itself is called “body of sin” (Rom. 6:6) and the whole man a “servant of sin.” If St. Paul were not speaking symbolically of the body of sin as a figure for the servile will, how could he cry: “As you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity, unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to justice, unto sanctification” (Rom. 6:19)? The symbol of the enslaved body is the symbol of a sinful being who is at the same time act and state; that is to say, a sinful being in whom the very act of self-enslavement suppresses itself as “act” and relapses into a “state.” The body is the symbol of this obliterated freedom, of a building from which the builder has withdrawn. In the language of St. Paul, the act is the “yielding” of the body to servitude (as you have yielded your members as servants), the state is the reign (let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies). A “yielding” of myself that is at the same time a “reign” over myself—there is the enigma of the servile will, of the will that makes itself a slave. AssociationValue: 0.36420845787973416


Seg: Finally, Plato himself, in spite of the Orphic myth of the soul exiled in a body that is its tomb, in spite of the temptation to harden the symbol of bodily captivity into a gnosis of the body as evil, in spite even of the guarantees that he gives to that gnosis for the future, knows perfectly well that the bodily captivity must not be taken literally, but as a sign of the servile will; the “prison” of the body is in the end only “the work of desire,” and “he who co-operates most in putting on the chains is perhaps the chained man himself” (Phaedo, 82d-e). Thus, the captivity of the body and even the captivity of the soul in fhe body are the symbol of the evil that the soul inflicts on itself, tb|e symbol of the affection of freedom by itself; the “loosing” of the soul assures us retrospec- AssociationValue: 0.5188688915337168


Seg: 17	'The Orphic myth of the twofold descent of man—divine and Titanic-does not seem to be paralleled by the description of Gilgamesh given by the scorpion-man who guards the gates to the abode of the Babylonian Noah: “He who has come to us—his body is the flesh of the gods”; to which the wife of the monster replies: "Two-thirds of him is god, one-third of him is human” (IX, U, 14 and 16). Apart from the ironic tone, this trait explains the heroic character of. the undertaking, but does not guarantee its -success. J.

Seg: Perhaps it is among the Orphics that the myth of the Titan gets its closest association with an anthropogony. The Orphic myth, we shall see, is in general a myth of man, a myth of “soul” and “body”; “the crime of the Titans,” who dismembered and devoured AssociationValue: 0.806663528779022


Seg: the new “type” of myth that we have now to consider is the one which all anthropological dualism endeavors to transpose and rationalize. What distinguishes it from all the other types is that it divides man into “soul” and “body”; it is on the basis of this myth that man understands himself as the same as his “soul” and “other than his “body.” AssociationValue: 0.5938332975086035


Seg: The mythical schema of the exiled soul can be understood through a comparison with the three other schemata which we have examined. It then becomes apparent that this myth is the only one which is, in the proper sense of the word, a myth of the “soul” and at the same time a myth of the "body.” It tells how the "soul,” divine in its origin, became human—how the "body,” a stranger to the soul and bad in many ways, falls to the lot of the soul—how the mixture of the soul and the body is the event that inaugurates the humanity of man and makes man the place of forgetting, the place where the primordial difference between soul and body is abolished. Divine as to his soul, earthly as to his body, man is the forgetting of the difference; and the myth tells how that happened. ' AssociationValue: 0.5672162676033667


Seg: It is noteworthy that Plato, in the fanciful etymology he proposes for “body” in the Cratylus, does not ascribe to the Orphics the exegesis of n&na by erij/m, but declares that the Orphics “imposed that name”; and this is the important thing. It has already been remarked that the Homeric hero does not have a “body,” but “members”; the body becomes a simple entity only in contrast with the "soul” and in virtue of the mythical symbolism which confers upon it a destiny other than that of the soul. Through the myth the body became an eschatological force: AssociationValue: 0.6190791094140884


Seg: It was the Orphics in particular, I think, who imposed that name, in the belief that the soul atones for the faults for which it is punished, and that, for its safekeeping \lva ov&ftpm]i it has, round about it, the body in the likeness of a prison; hence, that it is, as its name implies, the soma [the jail] of the soul, until the soul has paid its debt, and there is no need to change a single letter.

Seg: At first sight there appears to be no connection between the theme of expiation in and through the body and the theme of expiation in the lower world. It is necessary to get beyond those two half-themes in order to understand their profound unity. It must be understood that life is a repetition of hell, as hell is a doublet of life,, which gives a punitive meaning to those non-ethical torments the terrifying spectacle of which is displayed in life and history. The circularity of life and death is without doubt the more profound myth that subtends the two myths of punishment in the body (o-wjua) and punishment in Hades. To be born is to ascend from death to life, and to die is to descend from life to death. Thus the “body” can be the place of expiation for that other life which we call death, and Hades the place of expiation for the evil committed in this life which, for the profane, is the only life. Orphism, then, revived an old Indo-European theme of migration and reincarnation and at the same time plunged again into the depths of the old agrarian myths, which have always hinted at a hidden relation between the vernal rebirth of vital forces and the re-ascent of energies accumulated in the other realm, as if death increased the “wealth” (Plontos) of the prince of darkness (Pluto) and as if life could grow only by the forces granted to it by the other realm.3 But only a religion or a religious movement such as Orphism, which ascribes to the soul an occult reality in this life, could understand that circularity not only as a succession of two states external to one another, but as an alternation which appears AssociationValue: 0.581235363064693


Seg: in our present life in the condensed form of a superimposition; if fragment 133 of Pindar represents Orphism correctly/ the soul of the sleeping wakes and the soul of the waking sleeps. Soul and body, then, have inverse possibilities, which conceal each other. The soul is the witness of the other world, hidden while we are awake in this life and revealed in dreams, ecstasies, love, and death. The circularity of death and life and the coincidence of their inverted values give the body-tomb a fullness of meaning. If one life conceals the other, we must say with fragment 62 of Heraclitus: “Immortals, mortals; mortals, immortals; our life is their death and our death is their life,” and with the verses of Euripides cited in Plato’s Gorgias (492#): AssociationValue: 0.8792084918986464


Seg: This permutation of meaning between life and death in this life itself—which Plato sums up thus: “Perhaps in reality we are dead” (4926)—completes the meaning of the body that was adumbrated in the theme of the body-prison. For the aspect of the other world that is repeated in the body is not its divinity, but precisely its penal function. Here, again, the Gorgias (493a) is very illuminating: the reiterative penalties that the Greeks were pleased to imagine—> Sisyphus’ rock, the vessel of the Danaides,—which are penalties in virtue of their character as impotent, vain, perpetual labors, are reflected in this world, after having been projected into the other world, and become a cipher for the body, insofar as the body itself is an experience of reiteration.

Seg: <102>	“For those who have paid to Persephone the ransom for their old faults [ttoivAv TraXatoO irivQeoj], she sends their souls anew to the sunlight above at the ninth year; and from those souls there rise up illustrious kings, men mighty in their strength or great through their knowledge, who are honored among mortals forever as heroes without stain” (cited by Plato, Meno> 816-c). Nilsson compares this fragment, 133, with fragment 62 of Heraclitus and with Gorgias, 492c. From these passages, he concludes: “it follows that the idea according to which the body is the tomb of the soul is so closely bound to the migration of souls that the Orphics must have shared those beliefs” (op, ctf., p. 694). AssociationValue: 0.9062886602136582


Seg: This play of reflection between hell and the body is at the center of the understanding of the body; it explains that expiation in the body is quite the contrary of a purification; the soul in prison becomes a secondary delinquent corrupted by punishment; and so existence appears as an eternal relapse. The schema of exile, heightened by the schema of repetition, tends to make of the body the symbol of the misfortune of existence; for is there a more frightening idea than that which makes life a rebirth to punishment? In propagating itself from one life to the other, from a life to a death and from a death to a life, evil becomes the coincidence of selfinculpation and self-punishment. This mixture of condemnation and reiteration is the very figure of despair. AssociationValue: 0.4505766989248633


Seg: The interpretation of the “body” as an instrument of reiterated punishment provokes, as a reaction, a new interpretation of the soul, which may be called “puritanical” with E. R. Dodds: the soul is not from here; it comes from elsewhere; it is divine; in its present body it leads an occult existence, the existence of an exiled being that longs for its liberation. AssociationValue: 0.9437415533351725


Seg: Archaic Greek culture did not unify the soul any more than the body. Neither for the Ionians nor for the tragedians is the soul the unique existential root of thinking, meditating, feeling, suffering, and willing; it is scarcely more than the breath that the dying man gives back to the air, and that breath is not identified in a unique destiny with the scant and shadowy existence of death. “Soul” and “body” took substance together as the two dimensions, the two inverse vections of human existence. AssociationValue: 0.3845171133008735


Seg: Other cults taught enthusiasm, the possession of the soul by a god. What seems to be original in Orphism is that it interpreted this sudden alteration, this rapture, as an excursion from the body, as a voyage in the other world, rather than as a visitation or a possession, Ecstasy is now seen as manifesting the true nature of the soul, which daily existence hides.

Seg: <103>	"It was here that the new religious pattern made its fateful contribution: by crediting man with an occult self of divine origin, and thus setting soul and body at odds, it introduced into European culture a new interpretation of human existence, the interpretation we call puritanical” (E ,R, Dodds, The Greeks and the Irrationalp. 139). It is of little importance for us whether this type was foreign to Greece and whether it was shamanis-tic before being Orphic; what is important for us is that this type of "divine man” appeared in Greece, at the source of our occidental culture. AssociationValue: 0.3623693767059725


Seg: Other seers, healers, purifiers exercised their followers in psychic, excursions; <104> only the Orphics attained the revolutionary intuition that man is no longer to be defined as "mortal” but as "god.”. Wisdom is no longer “thinking as a mortal,” but recognizing oneself' as divine. The dividing line, the ontic difference, is no longer between the gods, who have kept immortality for themselves, and men, who have only vain hope for their share; it runs through man, separating his godlike immortality from the corruption of his body. Only this mutation in the very meaning of human existence made possible the legendary transcription of the life of Pythagoras and the death of Empedocles. It is the Orphic soul that cries out, in the Purifications: iyw S ryuv Oeos ap,ft par os, ovkcti dnjros. AssociationValue: 0.5081398518507281


Seg: Perhaps we must go still further. If we compare what we have just said about the "divinity” of the soul .with our previous remarks concerning the body as a jail and the mirror-play between the body and hell, it appears that the "divinity” of the soul does not consist simply in its capacity for survival; indeed, the idea of survival is on the way to being surpassed. The important thing now is to escape from the alternation of life and death, from reiteration; the “divine” soul is a soul that can be delivered from this reciprocal generation of contrary states, from the “wheel of birth and rebirth.” We are on the threshold of a new understanding of the self: the soul, having become the counterpole of the life-death pair, outlasts the time of repetition. It is true that before Plato, before the attempt in the Phaedo to link this perenniality of the soul with the non-temporality of the Forms, “immortality” is not yet “eternity”; it is only, so it seems, a force sufficient to keep the soul in existence through several bodies and several lives, as we see in Socrates’ discussion with Simmias and Gebes. Before philosophy there does not yet exist a carefully thought-out model for an existence that remains identical, the same as itself. But at least the myth, in imagining a cycle of life and death, suggests a sort of carrying forward of the Self beyond contradiction, a sort of Repose beyond discord. Philosophy would not have tried to conceive the soul’s identity with itself if the myth had not inspired it. AssociationValue: 0.7346716498959194


Seg: If we confine ourselves to the citations in the classics, we find several times an allusion to an “ancient curse.” Thus, in the fragment of Pindar cited by Plato in the Meno (816), expiation in this body implies a prior fault—iroivav iraXawv ttIvOcoh. Now, the idea of a fault committed in another life, besides making it possible to safeguard the old Jaw of retribution by spreading it out over a series of generations, as a text of the Laws (872d-e) on the vindictive justice of the gods says, implies a reference to a prior misfortune, to the transcendence of a choice which is both mine and older than I—in short, an evil that is both committed and undergone. Thus the prior life represents the unfathomable origin of an evil, the remembrance of which would be older than all memory, One might object, it is true, that the myth of the Titans points in another direction than that which is indicated in a Pythagorean verse quoted by Chrysippus, according to Aulus Gel-lius, VII, 2, 12: Fvwcm S’avdpwrovs avdaipcra mjp.at l^owas. AssociationValue: 0.6100715579558418


Seg: If now, turning toward the future, toward deliverance, we ask what type of “salvation” goes with this type of “evil,” one answer forces itself upon us: while the not-to-be-avowed theology of the wicked god excludes philosophy and finds fulfillment in the spectacle, the myth of the exiled soul Is par excellence the principle and promise of “knowledge,” of “gnosis.” The Orphics, says Plato, “named” the body; in naming the body, they named the soul. Now the act in which man perceives himself as soul, or, better, makes himself the same as his soul and other than his body—other' than the alternation of life and death,'—this purifying act par excellence is knowledge. In this awareness, in this awakening to itself of the exiled soul, all “philosophy” of the Platonic and Neo-Platonic type is contained. If the body is desire and passion, the soul is the origin and principle of any withdrawal, of any attempt to put a distance between the Aoyos on the one hand and the body and its waBo% on the other; and all knowledge of anything, every sci- AssociationValue: 0.9826890483318881


Seg: That is why it is not astonishing that history presents examples of the internalization of the Orphic symbol of the body-prison, corresponding to the externalization of the Biblical symbol of the fall. Just as St. Paul is on the road that goes from the image of the “fall” to the image of the “flesh,” Plato illustrates the opposite movement, leading from the evil body to the unjust soul. AssociationValue: 0.3325598902225018


Seg: It would be inexact to see in Plato only the accusation against the body—“that evil thing with which our soul is mixed/ says the Phaedo—and not to recognize the movement of review, rectification, and internalization of the previous symbolism of the body-prison. At the same time as he projects the Socratic analysis of the unjust soul into the body, he transmutes the body itself into a symbol of the passivity of the soul. On the one hand, the idea, which seems to be purely Socratic, of “tending” the soul, or “taking care’ of the soul, calls for the symbolism of the body; “care” of the soul presupposes, in fact, that the soul is like a body threatened by disease, which must be cared for and saved; and so ethics and politics are comparable to a “medicine” of the soul (Protagoras, 31 lb— 313a, 356c-357a). To this medical symbol of “care of the soul corresponds the symbol of the “disease of injustice” (to vomjfm tt}<s dSixtas, Gorgias, 480b), and of the other discordances in the soul, conceived on the model of derangements of the humors of the body, The same symbolism governs the idea of expiation; it “relieves” the soul of its wickedness, as purgation “relieves” the body of its evil humors. That is why the soul that has been punished—purged of its ills by punishment—is happier than the unjust soul that has not made atonement; this function of punishment supposes that injustice is like a disease and that justice, which administers punishment, is like the art of healing. Hence, before the body is the “cause” of injustice, its own ills are the symbol of injustice. It was this medical metaphor of disease and cure, directly applied to the ills and the care of the soul, which made possible, in the other direction, the philosophical transposition of the Orphic myth of the body-prison and its transmutation into a cipher of the unjust soul. The Socratic soul was ready for Plato’s resumption of the Orphic myths. That resumption marks both a re-immei’-sion of philosophy in myth and an advance toward a symbolism of a higher degree, in which the literal meaning of the bodily symbol is increasingly muted. AssociationValue: 0.5494483269857512


Seg: The progressive transmutation of the symbol of the body is quite visible in a dialogue like the Phaedo, of which it has been said that it runs through the whole gamut of the degrees of knowledge. Now, just as the meaning of the soul changes, as one rises above simple exhortation, which is itself close to mythical speech, the meaning of the body changes also. At the first level, it is living in its totality, and as such, that constitutes evil and forms the absolute contrary of philosophizing; the body is the counterpole of thought; apparently no innocence is left unsullied by contact with the world, since it is the body that “troubles the soul and prevents it from attaining truth and thought, every time we have dealings with it” (66a); philosophy consists then in the death of the body, in order to “behold things themselves with the soul itself” (66d); the body appears to be pre-eminently the locus of evil; “our soul is mixed with an evil thing” (66b), it is delivered up to the “dementia of the body” (67a). But even at this lower degree of knowledge, the evil influence of the body does not reside in what today we would call its materiality, nor in its power to make contact with things; rather, what is blamed in that contact is the “spell” that bewitches it and thus rivets the soul to the body, making it captive to the “contact”: “The soul of every human being, when it is intensely pleased or pained by something, thinks that the particular object of its feeling is the clearest and truest thing in the world, although it is not so at all” (83c). Hence, if the percept is not innocent, that is because the feeling that clings to it is not innocent either; and the feeling, in its turn, holds the soul captive because there is in the soul a dizziness that transforms feeling and perception into ?ra0o$. It is this dizziness in the soul that precipitates the soul into a body of desire (79c). Hence “passivity” is secretly an action of the soul which makes itself a captive, which delivers itself up to imprisonment: “And the astonishing thing about this prison, as philosophy has seen, is that it is the work of desire and that he who helps most to load the prisoner with his chains is perhaps the prisoner himself” (82e). If this is so, it must be admitted that the soul is “its own tormentor.” AssociationValue: 0.5327975133078577


Seg: coverings which are put on and taken off like a garment; but the practice of purification already begins to attract the myth of the “body” in the direction of meanings that are symbolic, rather than literal. AssociationValue: 0.4035156057635219


Seg: That is why, when Plato goes farther up in the hierarchy of degrees of knowledge, the meaning of the body changes with the meaning of the soul. The soul is not only a fugitive that goes from body to body, wearing them out one after another; it is also—at least at a level which is not yet the level of dialectics—an existence characterized by its “likeness” to the Ideas (at a higher level it will be constituted by an Idea, the Idea of life). Now, if the soul is “that which is most like” the Ideas, which remain identical with themselves, the body is “that which is most like” that which perishes. Just as the soul is in labor with regard to being, so the body is less a thing than a direction of existence, a counterlikeness: “Then the soul is dragged by the body in the direction of those things that never preserve their identity; it wanders about, it is troubled, its head spins as if it were drunk, because it is in contact with things of that kind” (79c). Thus two existential movements are sketched, two movements governed by two “likenesses,” by two “kinships,” one with the perishable and one with the immutable. Just now we contrasted the Idea and the Body, in a naive way, as two “worlds”; but the soul itself, which is between the two, is movement toward both—a movement by which it attempts to make itself immutable by means of geometry and dialectics, and a movement that consists in making itself perishable through the vertigo of desire. AssociationValue: 0.9859357665451262


Seg: That “something evil” which is the body is, then, less a thing than the direction of a vertigo, the counterpole of the likeness of the soul to the idea. The soul makes itself like the order of perishable things, instead of “seeking refuge” in the ideas. <116> AssociationValue: 0.9399897533669429


Seg: <116> The eschatological myth which separates the second and the third parts of the Phaedo itself bears the mark of this advance in reflection. The unjust soul, arrived in the underworld, bears .the trace of its injustice, as blows that it has inflicted upon itself; it is by these traces in the naked soul that the judge recognizes the affinity of the soul for its bodyfri <rw^aroet5^ 81c). This affinity is represented jn the myth by the wandering of the dead man, haunted by the desire for a new body appropriated to its care. The trace of the old body is like the habitus of the soul, its customary manner of being “chained and glued” (82c), "nailed” (83d) to its body. AssociationValue: 0.3417752913213487


Seg: That the dizziness of desire must be understood thus is already suggested by the Gratylus. There we find an allusion to an active-passive dizziness that escapes from a literal interpretation of the body-prison and already belongs to an interpretation of evil as a positive movement of the soul. Reflecting on the perversion of language, the Cratylus evokes the figure—still mythical—of a drunken legislator as the source of the aberrant meanings. If there is a language of becomings if mobilism—itself a perversion of philosophy —finds words to express itself and finally to engender itself in expressing itself, that is because the initiators of that illusion “have themselves fallen into a sort of whirlpool where they are agitated and confused, and they have dragged us in after them” (439c), AssociationValue: 0.3707257738843511


Seg: We have now made the opposite journey of the one that led us from the Socratic idea of the unjust soul to the idea of an evil influence of the body, taken over from the myths of defilement. The dizziness that seemed to mount from the body toward the soul, in a first philosophical approximation that was still close to the language of myth, is really an evil of injustice, an evil of false discourse, which paralyzes the soul and delivers it up to the sorcery of its suffering. The body, then, is no longer the origin of evil, but only the "place” of the soul’s captivity, while desire is "temptation,” and injustice is the origin of the evil by which the soul makes itself like its body. Injustice begets the dizziness that disrupts the original community of the soul with truth, and produces the deceptive likeness of the soul to its body. AssociationValue: 0.46524475384624525


Seg: Is it possible to interpret the myth of the fall in the Phaedrus similarly? I think so. The opposition between the Biblical fall, construed as a deviation of the will, and the Platonic fall, construed as a-fall into the body, should not be pushed too far. Otherwise, besides remaining a prisoner of the most literal interpretation of "body”—an interpretation encouraged, it is true, by those Platonic “revivals” which are closest to the myth,—one does not take account of the structure of the myth itself. We have had occasion to begin this exegesis in our phenomenology of fallibility and to note that the myth is a myth of "composition” before being a myth of a "fall.” By the same token, evil is not exactly outside, in an alien and seductive body, but inside, in a discordance of self with self, the decisive philosophical interpretation of which belongs to the ethical order. The soul is composite and incarnate before the fall; that statement is so true that the proof of immortality in the Phdedrus rests on the hypothesis of a soul that moves itself in moy-ing a body under its control. The combination of a “self-mover’ and a “moved” is, then, prior to evil (245c~246a); it characterizes all the members of the great heavenly procession—gods, stars, and human souls: “How does it happen that mortal and immortal merit the name of living being? Let us try to explain this. Soul in all its species has charge of all that is soulless” (246b). Thus a god is “an immortal living being, possessing a soul and a body which are by nature united forever” (246d), As to the world-soul, that “perfect and ever-winged soul administers the whole cosmos” (246c). The Timaeus says the same thing (34c-36d): the whole of the corporeal is in the soul, not the soul in it (36d-e). AssociationValue: 0.46408180307537705


Seg: As the soul is from the beginning composite and corporeal, so it is from the beginning a mover: “As it goes around in the whole universe, it takes on different forms here and there” (246b). Thus, the business of administering the body and the world is a journey (piTtopoiropet, 246b-c), and more precisely a desire to ascend, oriented in the opposite direction from heaviness, and to “lead upward that which is heavy” (246d). It is here, in the “composition” that precedes the fall, that the nascent disagreement between the rational and the emotional appears. This disagreement is not between the soul and the body, but is in the soul itself. Hence, it does not differ fundamentally from what we have called above the double likeness inscribed in the soul. That double likeness has only been enriched by a new trait that brings the "composition” of the soul in the Phaedrus closer to the tripartite division of the soul in the Republic, IV, where the frailty of the soul, its original ambivalence, is connected with an intermediate, “ambiguous” function, dvpos, which sums up in itself the double solicitaton of the soul. Thus the soul is originally a dramatic or polemic multiplicity, in which feeling does not play the role of a principle of evil, but rather of a principle of fallibility or temptation.

Seg: Everything leads to the conclusion that the philosophical point of the myth is the suggestion that the “earthy” signifies the captivity imposed on the soul by itself, the “world” in St. John’s sense, the “flesh” (and the “body”) in St, Paul’s sense. In short, it is “injustice” which predominates in the philosophical exegesis of the earthy, just as it is the earthy “body” that mythically symbolizes injustice.

Seg: as corruption destroys the body, but, so to speak, consecrates and eternalizes its unhappiness; only the soul is an exception to the rule that evil destroys the thing of which it is the corruption (609a); the soul is that being which is not made to die by its evil. This evil, then, cannot be foreign to the soul, but must be its own; no longer the body, but injustice. AssociationValue: 0.7720038491280345


Seg: We have developed to considerable length the Platonic transposition of the Orphic myth. For the reader instructed by the prophets of Israel and the Christian Kerygma, it represents an inflection of the symbolism of the “evil body” in the direction of the theme of “evil choice,” and at the same time it helps to make intelligible the contamination by each other of the two mythical cycles, that which gravitates around the primordial “Anthropos” and that which begins with the mythology of the “body-prison.” If we admit that, in St. Paul and St. John, the “flesh” is more than the physical body and the “world” more than the universe of things, it is fair to read Plato with the same understanding for the symbolism and the same irony, Consequently, the difference between the “flesh” according to St. Paul and the “body” according to Plato tends to vanish. We do not say, however, that there is no difference; for just as St. Paul is preserved from the gnosis of the evil body by his Adamic mythology, Plato is separated from the Biblical conception of evil by his attachment to the Greek con-cepton of Desire, to AoyioTtKov and to tiri$vni)TiKov constitute the fundamental polarity of existence according to Book IV of the Republic; the Rational and the Desirous form a pair of contraries in which the second term tends to take up into itself everything that blocks and resists thought. That is why the “concupisci-ble” in Plato cannot coincide exactly with the “flesh” according AssociationValue: 0.3738196382132373


Seg: Hence the contribution of Aristotle, who restated the pi’oblem of pleasure and directed ethical reflection on pleasure toward the activity of which pleasure is only the bloom or the premium, is so much the more valuable; we shall come back to it. But Stoicism, in spite of Epicurus, led ethical reflection back into the old groove of the Cynics. Thus there is a line of force in Greek thought which goes from the Socratics through Plato to the Stoics, according to which evil is the passivity of desire, rather than active evil will. That is why this type of thought has a natural affinity to the Orphic myth, rather than to the Adamic myth. Through the Orphic myth, it prolongs the symbolism of defilement and the tradition of mystico-ritual purifications, rather than the Biblical symbolism of sin. The whole series of treatises on the “passions of the soul” is contained in germ in this old pact between Greek philosophy of the Platon iz-ing type and the myth of the soul exiled in the prison of an evil body.  <118> AssociationValue: 0.403817343577617
